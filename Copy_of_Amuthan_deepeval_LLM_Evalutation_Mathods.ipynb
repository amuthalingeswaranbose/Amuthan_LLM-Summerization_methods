        "        \"input\": \"\"\"The efficacy of flunarizine compared with placebo for migraine prophylaxis in adults was evaluated in 10 placebo-controlled studies in 453 subjects. Across these studies, subjects with common or classic migraine received treatment with flunarizine 10 mg daily or placebo for durations of 3 to 4 months. Seven of the studies showed a significant effect of flunarizine         compared with placebo in reducing the frequency of migraine attacks, and thus, support the efficacy of flunarizine in prophylaxis of migraine. Across the studies that reported effects on migraine severity and duration, most found no significant decreases in duration or severity of attack with flunarizine versus placebo except for the study by Mendenopoulous et al (1985), which showed a significant reduction in severity of attacks with flunarizine after 2 months of treatment and the study by Diamond and Schenbaum (1983), which showed significant decreases in HUIC (severity and duration) and PIR (pain intensity) indices with flunarizine administered for 12 weeks. Three studies failed to show a significant superiority of flunarizine compared with placebo, although a tendency towards significant differences was observed. This result is likely due the existence of a high placebo effect. Studies of prophylactic treatment of migraine have shown a high variability in the rate of placebo response, which may be due in part to the inherent variability in responses measured over a period of months. In the pooled analysis of 2 identical studies in a total of 143 evaluable subjects (JRD 14,950/002 and JRD 14,950/004), a significant difference in headache index was found between flunarizine and placebo after 1 month of treatment; however, differences in efficacy parameters were only marginally significant for flunarizine at the last visit. Al Deeb et al (1992) noted that baseline factors, including higher mean age, higher number of attacks, and greater number of classic versus common migraineurs in the flunarizine group, may have contributed to the lack of significant differences between the treatments. Thomas et al (1991) found no significant benefit with flunarizine compared with placebo in analysis of individual indices; however, comparison of median values of indices between the treatment groups showed that flunarizine provided statistically significant reductions in all headache indices from baseline and compared with placebo. The efficacy of flunarizine in migraine prophylaxis in adults was evaluated in 32 active-controlled studies in 6,246 subjects. Twelve studies compared flunarizine with beta-blockers including metoprolol, nadolol, and propranolol. Flunarizine was also compared with acupuncture, betahistine, methysergide, nifedipine, nimodipine, nimodipine plus Yufeng Ningxin, pizotifen, topiramate, valproate, Zhengtian capsules, and -DHEC. One study compared 2 different dosages of flunarizine (5 mg and 10 mg daily), 1 study compared conventional flunarizine to a bioequivalent matrix flunarizine formulation, and 1 study compared flunarizine monotherapy to flunarizine combined with tSNS and with tSNS alone. Across the studies that included propranolol as a comparator, all found that flunarizine was at least as effective as propranolol in the prevention of migraine attack in adults. One of these was a large Company-sponsored randomized, double-blind study (FLU-INT-5 [1999]) that included 808 subjects with migraine treated with flunarizine 5 or 10 mg once daily or propranolol 160 mg daily for a duration of 16 weeks. Flunarizine 10 mg was as effective as propranolol in all evaluated efficacy parameters. Flunarizine 5 mg was also as effective as propranolol in reducing mean attack frequency, but more subjects were assessed as responders (had ≥50% decrease in attack frequency) with propranolol. Verspeelt et al (1996) compared flunarizine, at doses of 10 mg/day in those <65 years of age and 5 mg/day in those >65 years of age, to propranolol 40 to 120 mg/day in 1,601 subjects with migraine; the treatment duration was 6 months. Both treatments were effective with no significant difference in the number of attacks or in general feeling of well-being; however, propranolol was superior to flunarizine for reduction in the severity of attacks. One of the reviewed studies concluded that flunarizine resulted in a statistically significant better response rate versus propranolol. Zhang et al (2002) reported that flunarizine 10 mg/day compared with propranolol 30 mg/day, each administered for 8 weeks,provided a significantly greater total response rate of 93% versus 71% with propranolol. Studies that evaluated flunarizine compared with metoprolol or nadolol reported that the treatments were equally effective in the prevention of migraine attacks. In the remaining studies, flunarizine was found to be at least as effective as acupuncture, betahistine,  methysergide,  nifedipine,  nimodipine,  pizotifen, topiramate, valproate, Zhengtian capsules, and -DHEC.  Several of these treatments have not received regulatory approval and are used off label for migraine prevention; additionally, some are no longer recommended in treatment guidelines. Topiramate and valproate, however, are considered first-line treatments for prevention of migraine. In a long-term, randomized study in 150 subjects with migraine with aura (classic) or without aura, flunarizine 5 mg/day reduced the number of migraine and headache days from 4.41.5/month at baseline to 2.5±1.1/month after 12 months of treatment compared with a reduction from 4.61.4/month to 2.60.9/month with topiramate 25 to 100 mg/day. A second randomized study using a flunarizine dose of 10 mg/day compared with topiramate 50 mg/day for 8 weeks in 62 subjects with chronic migraine found reductions from baseline in total headache days/2 weeks of -4.9 with flunarizine vs -2.3 with topiramate (p=0.012) and in total migraine days/2 weeks of -4.3 vs -1.4, respectively (p=0.001). In 2 nonrandomized studies of flunarizine compared with topiramate, similar response rates, defined as subjects with at least 50% reduction in migraine attacks, were observed with flunarizine 5 mg/day and topiramate 100 mg/day (Study 1: 75% vs 70%, respectively; Study 2: 67% vs 71%, respectively). In a randomized, double-open study with flunarizine 10 mg/day and valproate 1 g/day administered for 8 weeks in 44 subjects with migraine with or without aura, each treatment resulted in a significant reduction from baseline in the mean number of migraine attacks (from 4.4 to 1.8 with flunarizine vs 5.1 to 1.6 with valproate; p<0.01 within each group).  Mu et al (2018) reported that nimodipine (120 mg/day) plus Yufeng Ningxin was superior to flunarizine 10 mg/day in reducing the number of migraine days and in response rate after 7 weeks of treatment. However, this study had several limitations including an insufficient study duration of 7 weeks (it should have been at least 3 months for a critical evaluation), lack of a placebo arm or run-in period, and unclear randomization and blinding. Nimodipine has not been approved for migraine prophylaxis and additional use of the herbal remedy Yufeng Ningxin may have accounted for the rapid migraine relief in the nimodipine arm. The secondary endpoint of response rate should have been used as the primary endpoint. The 3 non-controlled, open-label studies in 2,527 subjects are supportive for the efficacy of flunarizine for migraine prophylaxis in adults. All showed significant reductions in headache frequency from baseline with flunarizine 5 to 10 mg/day administered over 12 to 20 weeks. A recently published meta-analysis by Stubberud et al (2019) included 25 placebo- or active-controlled studies with flunarizine for migraine prophylaxis. Twenty-three of the 25 studies in the analysis are also reviewed in this Clinical Overview; the remaining 2 studies evaluated flunarizine dosages outside of those recommended in the Vietnamese Package Insert and were therefore excluded from this Clinical Overview. Stubberud et al reported that flunarizine was superior to placebo, comparable to propranolol, metoprolol, sodium valproate, and topiramate, and superior to pizotifen in reducing migraine frequency. However, acupuncture treatment was superior to flunarizine in reducing migraine frequency, intensity, and drug consumption. The efficacy of flunarizine compared with placebo for migraine prophylaxis in children with classic or common migraine was evaluated in 2 placebo-controlled studies in 118 subjects. Flunarizine 5 mg/day for 12 weeks resulted in statistically significant decreases in migraine attack frequency from baseline. Additionally, comparison of migraine frequency at the end of study showed statistically significantly fewer migraines with flunarizine versus placebo. Treatment with flunarizine also produced significant reductions from baseline in the duration of migraine attacks. The efficacy of flunarizine for migraine prophylaxis in children was compared with topiramate,  propranolol, dihydroergotamine, amitriptyline, cyproheptadine, and acetylsalicylic acid across 5 active-controlled studies in 278 subjects.  The randomized, double-blind study by Lütschg and Vassella (1990) showed that 4-month treatment with flunarizine 5 to 10 mg/day or propranolol 30 to 120 mg/day produced similar reductions in the frequency of migraine attacks  (76.4% flunarizine vs 73.3% propranolol) in children with simple or classic migraine. However, flunarizine had no effect on the duration or intensity of migraine attacks, whereas propranolol showed a decrease in migraine intensity. Similarly, the 4-month, open-label, active-controlled study by Hirfanoglu et al (1987) in children with migraine with or without aura showed a 71.5% reduction in migraine frequency with flunarizine 5 to 10 mg/day; corresponding reductions with amitriptyline 0.5 mg/kg/day, cyproheptadine 0.2 mg/kg/day, and propranolol 10 to 40 mg/day were 80.1%, 78.8%, and 68.2%, respectively. The 6-month non-randomized comparator study by Topcu et al (2014) reported significant decreases in PedMIDAS scores with flunarizine 5 to 10 mg/day, topiramate 1 to 2 mg/kg/day, and propranolol 20 to 40 mg/day, although reductions with topiramate and propranolol were significantly greater compared with flunarizine. 56 Lastra Martinez et al (1990) found similar efficacy with flunarizine (10 mg/day) and dihydroergotamine (3 doses of 1.5 mg/day per week after Week 3) (79% and 87% subjects with improvement, respectively) in migraine frequency, intensity, and duration in children with classic or common migraine. In a prospective, double-blind study in children with classic or uncomplicated migraine, there were no significant differences between flunarizine 5 to 10 mg/day and acetylsalicylic acid 100 to 200 mg/day in reduction of migraine attack frequency or symptoms. An additional study compared the efficacy of flunarizine with flunarizine combined with behavioral therapy in 90 children with migraine. Flunarizine, at doses of 0.2 mg/kg/day up to 10 mg/day, administered for 3 months was found to be more effective when combined with behavioral therapy versus monotherapy, as shown by significantly lower PedMIDAS scores. Four non-controlled open-label studies in 263 subjects are supportive for the efficacy of flunarizine for prevention of migraine in children. An open-label study of flunarizine 10 mg/day administered for 8 weeks to 200 children and adolescents with migraine found a significant decrease in migraine attack frequency and severity. Boccia et al (2006) reported significantly decreased migraine frequency at 1 and 2 months after daily administration of flunarizine 5 mg in children with migraine.  Similarly, Guidetti reported in children with common or classic migraine a significant decrease in migraine frequency after 1 month of treatment with flunarizine 5 mg/day, which was maintained after 6 months of treatment. Visudtibhan et al (2004) found that 66.7% of children administered flunarizine 5 to 10 mg/day had a decrease in migraine frequency. Overall, the reviewed efficacy data from studies of flunarizine in adults and children with migraine support the authorized indication of flunarizine in Vietnam for the maintenance treatment of migraine, when other treatments are ineffective or poorly tolerated. Literature searches to identify relevant studies that support the efficacy and safety of flunarizine in the prevention of migraine in adults and children were performed as reported in Section 4. The available safety results from the reviewed studies are discussed in Section 5.1. The most frequently reported AEs across the placebo-controlled studies of flunarizine for migraine prophylaxis in adults were weight gain and sedation. In the pooled analysis of 2 identical studies in a total of 143 evaluable subjects (JRD 14,950/002 and JRD 14,950/004), there were significantly higher incidences of weight gain (p=0.00131) and depression (p=0.0344) with flunarizine compared with placebo.  Other reported AEs with flunarizine across the reviewed placebo-controlled studies in adults included fatigue, headache, pain, nausea, drowsiness, rhinitis, depression, tiredness, diarrhea, giddiness, galactorrhea, stomach complaints, difficultly sleeping, sleepiness, lethargy, decreased motivation, weight loss, muscle aches, dry mouth, and numbness and tingling in hands.   One SAE of chest pain was reported with flunarizine. The subject had bypass surgery and recovered without sequelae; no further details were reported on the case. One study by Mendenopoulos et al (1985)reported that no adverse reactions occurred and that no changes in body weight were observed with flunarizine. Results from the reviewed 32 active-controlled studies in 6,246 adults with migraine indicate a similar safety profile with flunarizine as observed in the placebo-controlled studies in adults. Across the reviewed studies, the most commonly reported AEs with flunarizine were somnolence, weight gain, fatigue, and drowsiness.  In the Company- sponsored study FLU-INT-5 in 808 subjects, the majority of AEs were mild or moderate in severity. 10 Six subjects reported SAEs; there were no cases of death or EPS. In the large postmarketing observational study in 1,601 subjects, the safety evaluation was focused on EPS and depression.  In those treated with flunarizine, 2 subjects reported EPS and 34 subjects reported depression. Non-controlled, open-label studies in 2,527 subjects reported drowsiness, asthenia, weight increase, fatigue, somnolence, appetite increase, and depression as the most commonly occurring AEs with flunarizine. The meta-analysis of 25 placebo- or active-controlled studies with flunarizine for migraine prophylaxis concluded that flunarizine was well tolerated. The reviewed studies provide evidence supporting the safety of flunarizine in children with migraine. Adverse events reported with flunarizine in 2 placebo-controlled studies with children included drowsiness, weight gain, GI complaints, and fatigue; there were no SAEs reported. Flunarizine had no effect on routine laboratory assessments, blood pressure, or electroencephalogram measurements. Adverse events with flunarizine across the 6 active-controlled studies included drowsiness, paresthesia, increased appetite, weight gain, increased fatigue, shortness of breath, concentration disorders, and stomach pain. No SAEs or cases of EPS were observed. No AEs were reported with flunarizine in non-controlled open-label studies. Overall, the safety data in adults and children in the reviewed studies are consistent with the known safety profile of flunarizine, as described in the current Vietnamese Package Insert.\"\"\",\n",
        "        \"actual_output\": \"\"\"The primary objective of these research studies was to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of migraine in children and adolescents, and to evaluate the effectiveness of various treatments, particularly flunarizine, in managing this condition. The studies also aimed to understand the relationship between migraine and other conditions such as functional gastrointestinal disorders, and the impact of these treatments on patients' quality of life. The diagnostic criteria used across the studies varied, but generally included a history of recurrent headaches, often accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea or vomiting, and a lack of response to analgesics. Boccia et al (2006) conducted a study on 60 children suffering from migraines and functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), treating them with a daily dose of 5 mg flunarizine for two months. Chen et al (2014) carried out a similar study on 90 children, dividing them into two groups, one of which received behavioral therapy along with oral flunarizine, while the other group received only oral flunarizine. Guidetti et al (1987) treated 13 preadolescents with severe migraine with a single 5-mg dose of Flunarizine at night for 2 months. Hirfanoglu et al (2009) conducted a controlled clinical trial on 77 children with migraine, treating them with one of four drugs: cyproheptadine, amitriptyline, propranolol, or flunarizine for 4 months. Lutschg et al (1990) conducted a study involving 33 children aged between 3 to 15 years, testing the efficacy of flunarizine and propranolol in migraine prevention, with 4 months of treatment with either drug. Min et al (2012) administered flunarizine to 200 children and adolescents for eight weeks. Topcu et al (2014) divided 88 children with migraine into three treatment groups, receiving either topiramate, flunarizine, or propranolol for 6 months. Visudtibhan et al (2004) administered flunarizine for 6 months in a prospective study on children who had the indication for prophylactic treatment of migraine. Lastra martinez et al (1990) conducted a randomized study on 50 children affected by classic or common migraine, administering either dihydroergotamine or flunarizine for 6 months. Pothmann et al (1987) studied 30 children suffering from at least 2 attacks/month of common or classical migraine for more than 1 year, administering either Acetylsalicylic Acid or Flunarizine for 3 months. Boccia et al (2006) evaluated 50 migrainous children for the prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) and the effects of flunarizine on gastrointestinal manifestations, finding that gastrointestinal disorders were present in 70% of the patients and that flunarizine significantly reduced the mean frequency of abdominal pain, vomiting, and headache per month. Chen et al (2014) conducted a study on 90 children with migraine, finding significant differences in Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment Score (PedMIDAS) and improved Bussone headache index between the treatment and control groups after 3 months of treatment. Guidetti et al (1987) tested the prophylactic efficacy and side effects of flunarizine in 13 preadolescents with severe migraine, finding a significant decrease in attack frequency. Hirfanoglu et al (2009) evaluated levels of tumor necrosis factor a, interleukin-16, interleukin-6, and leptin in children with migraine after various therapies, finding that each of the four drugs decreased the frequency, duration, severity of headache, and the PedMIDAS score. Lutschg et al (1990) found a reduction in the number of migraine attacks in 75% of the flunarizine group and in 73.8% of the propranolol group. Min et al (2012) analyzed 200 migraine patients, finding a significant decrease in both the frequency and severity of migraines after eight weeks of treatment with flunarizine. Topcu et al (2014) analyzed the efficacy of topiramate, propranolol, and flunarizine in 88 patients with migraines, finding that all three treatments significantly decreased the PedMIDASs, but topiramate and propranolol were more effective than flunarizine. Visudtibhan et al (2004) observed improvement in 66% of patients who received flunarizine, with 23% having no recurrent attack. Lastra Martinez et al (1990) administered dihydroergotamine or flunarizine to 50 children affected by classic or common migraine, finding significant improvement in the frequency, intensity, and length of the episodes in 87% of cases with dihydroergotamine and in 79% of cases with flunarizine. Pothmann et al (1987) studied 30 children suffering from common or classical migraine and found no significant difference in the reduction of attack frequency or symptoms between acetylsalicylic acid and flunarizine. Boccia et al (2006) found that subjects treated with flunarizine experienced no relevant side effects during their study. However, Chen et al (2014) and Hirfanoglu et al (2009) did not provide specific safety results or adverse events in their respective studies on children with migraines. Guidetti et al (1987) reported no significant interference with pituitary, beta-pancreatic, or gonadal function after treatment, and no serious side effects in 10- to 13-year-olds over a 2-month course. Lutschg et al (1990) noted temporary side effects in a few patients, with increased fatigue being the most common. Min et al (2012) found flunarizine to be effective and safe for migraine prophylactic treatment in a study of 200 patients. Topcu et al (2014) found that Topiramate treatment caused side effects such as dizziness, lack of attention, and palpitations in a few cases, and Flunarizine was withdrawn in four patients as it proved ineffective. Visudtibhan et al (2004) observed no adverse effects in their study. Lastra martinez et al (1990) found that a small percentage of patients experienced side effects with dihydroergotamine and flunarizine, but these were tolerable and did not require changes in the therapeutic regimen. Pothmann et al (1987) reported minor side effects such as slight body weight gain or abdominal pain after intake, but these did not necessitate interruption of prophylaxis. They also found no effects on blood pressure and heart rate during the observation period in either the ASS or flunarizine groups. Studies have shown that flunarizine is effective in reducing the frequency, intensity, and duration of migraines in children. It has been found to be particularly beneficial in children with vegetative lability and those with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). The drug has also been shown to improve the quality of life of patients, as measured by the Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment Score (PedMIDAS). However, some studies have found that other drugs, such as topiramate and propranolol, may be more effective than flunarizine in reducing the frequency and duration of migraines. In terms of safety, flunarizine has been generally well-tolerated, with the most common side effect being increased fatigue. However, some studies have reported other side effects such as dizziness, lack of attention, palpitations, and weight gain. Despite these side effects, the drug has been deemed safe for use in children and adolescents.\"\"\"\n",

        "#         \"input\": \"\"\"This review of the external and internal literature identified 20 articles relevant to the efficacy and safety of the QW bortezomib regimen compared with the BIW regimen for the treatment of MM; other conditions including AL amyloidosis, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, NSCLC, and prostate cancer; and within combination therapies. QW bortezomib regimens were uniformly effective and well tolerated when administered as a monotherapy or combination drug therapy. In subjects with MM, systemic AL amyloidosis, non-Hodgkin lymphoma,1,4,6,17 and NSCLC, the bortezomib QW regimen was similarly effective to the BIW regimen either as a monotherapy or combination drug therapy. In subjects with systemic AL amyloidosis: The PFS rate was similar between the QW and BIW treatment regimens; The BIW regimen was associated with the development of more neuropathies, Grade 3/4 toxicities, AEs, and dose reductions. In subjects with non-Hodgkin lymphoma: The BIW regimen was associated with more Grade 3/4 toxicities and severe neuropathies. In subjects with NSCLC: The frequency and severity of neutropenia was increased in the BIW treatment group. Febrile neutropenia and thrombocytopenia with bleeding were dose-limiting toxicities associated with the bortezomib BIW regimen, but not the QW regimen. The increased dose intensity of bortezomib led to increased gastrointestinal toxicity as well as myelosuppression in the bortezomib BIW regimen group. When used in a combination therapy, for the treatment of MM, a total of 5 studies demonstrated that the QW bortezomib regimen was as effective as the BIW regimen.When used in a combination therapy, in subjects with MM, the CR was higher in the QW treatment group compared with the BIW group; however, in another study the CR was similar across the 2 bortezomib regimens. When used in a combination therapy, the bortezomib QW regimen was associated with fewer neuropathies, and Grade 3/4 AEs compared with the BIW regimen.When used in a combination therapy, the median TTP was not significantly different between the QW and BIW groups in elderly patients, which is in keeping with evidence that decreasing the frequency of bortezomib dosing in younger patients can reduce neurological toxicity without impacting adversely on survival. When examined in the context of maintenance treatment for MM, the QW bortezomib regimen was found to reduce the incidence of AEs without reducing the clinical efficacy.\"\"\",\n",
        "#         \"actual_output\": \"\"\"The text data presents 22 clinical studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of bortezomib, often in combination with other treatments such as rituximab, dexamethasone, and cyclophosphamide, in patients with various diseases including multiple myeloma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia, and AL amyloidosis. The studies also compare different administration schedules of bortezomib, including once-weekly and twice-weekly regimens. The data presents a categorization of various studies based on their design, with four Phase I and II studies by Agathocleous et al (2010), Kraft et al (2011), Ribrag et al (2009), and Voortman et al (2007), two Phase III studies by Bringhen et al (2010) and Mateos et al (2015), six retrospective studies by Fukushima et al (2011), Lee et al (2014), Moore et al (2013), Parrish et al (2011), Shen et al (2017), and Wang et al (2012), two prospective studies by Kim et al (2017) and Wei et al (2016), two randomized multicenter studies by Kumar et al (2012) and de Vos et al. (2009), and five other study designs by Davies et al (2007), Gerecitano et al (2011), Gozzetti et al (2010), Reece et al (2011), and Sidana et al (2017). In Phase I and II studies conducted by Agathocleous et al (2010), Kraft et al (2011), Ribrag et al (2009), and Voortman et al (2007), a total of 148 patients were analyzed. The studies showed varying response rates to different treatments, with bortezomib and rituximab showing a 67% overall response rate, single-agent bortezomib alone or combined with hormone blockade significantly decreasing the slope of the log PSA, bortezomib combined with 6 cycles of R-CHOP achieving a complete response in 84% of patients, and bortezomib in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine resulting in 13 partial responses, 17 stable diseases, and 4 progressive diseases. The main toxicities reported were neurological, gastro-intestinal, and haematological, with neurotoxicity, constipation, infections, cardiac events, diarrhea, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia being dose-limiting toxicities. In Phase III studies conducted by Bringhen et al (2010) and Mateos et al (2015), a total of 851 patients were analyzed. The studies showed that a twice-weekly bortezomib schedule or a once-weekly schedule resulted in overall response rates of 85% and 86% respectively, and overall survival was significantly longer in the higher (>39 mg/m²) versus lower (<39 mg/m²) cumulative bortezomib dose group when used with bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone (VMP). Nonhematologic grade 3/4 adverse events were reported in 35% of once-weekly patients and 51% of twice-weekly patients, with a lower incidence of early treatment discontinuations due to adverse events, patient choice, disease progression, or death in the higher cumulative bortezomib dose group. In retrospective studies conducted by Fukushima et al (2011), Lee et al (2014), Moore et al (2013), Parrish et al (2011), Shen et al (2017), and Wang et al (2012), a total of 201 patients were analyzed, including 19 elderly patients and 89 MM patients. The studies showed varying response rates to different treatments, with BD therapy achieving at least a partial response in 77.3% of patients, bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisolone (VMP) showing an overall hematologic response in 84% of patients and a complete response in 37% of patients, weekly intravenous bortezomib being effective in relapsed/refractory MM, and bortezomib in association with dexamethasone resulting in 37% of patients in the elderly cohort relapsing. Severe adverse events were reported, including thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, pneumonia, sensory neuropathy, motor neuropathy, and haematological toxicity. In prospective studies conducted by Kim et al (2017) and Wei et al (2016), a total of 207 patients were analyzed. The studies showed that 9 cycles of VMP resulted in an overall response rate (ORR) of 72.9% and a complete response (CR) rate of 20.3%, and modified Bor-based combination therapy resulted in an ORR of 76.6%. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 98.3% of the patients, with the most common AE being diarrhea. The incidences of adverse events were similar except grade 1-4 peripheral neuropathy (PN) rate was 10% in the modified regime group and 32.4% in control. In randomized multicenter studies conducted by Kumar et al (2012) and de Vos et al (2009), a total of 81 patients were analyzed. The studies showed that combinations of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VDCR) resulted in 80%, 73%, 63%, and 82% of patients having a confirmed response after 4 cycles, and twice-weekly/weekly bortezomib plus rituximab resulted in an ORR of 49% and a median TTP of 7.0 months. At least one grade > 3 AE was seen in ~ 80% of patients in each arm, with grade 3 or worse adverse events seeming more common in arm A (54%) versus arm B (35%). In other study designs conducted by Davies et al (2007), Gerecitano et al (2011), Gozzetti et al (2010), Reece et al (2011), and Reeder et al (2010), a total of 104 patients were analyzed, including 20 MM patients. The studies showed varying response rates to different treatments, with pemetrexed and bortezomib resulting in 2 partial responses, 13 stable diseases, and 11 progressions, rituximab and cyclophosphamide resulting in overall hematologic response rates of 68.8%, 66.7%, and 38.9% in the 1.6 mg/m² once-weekly, 1.3 mg/m² twice-weekly, and lower-dose groups respectively, and a 3-drug combination of bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (CyBorD) resulting in an overall response of 90% with 41% CR/nCR and 60% VGPR or better. The most common grade 3/4 toxicity was neutropenia, with most toxicities across all dose levels and cycles being grade 1 or 2. The treatment was generally safe, with hematological toxicity being mild to moderate and manageable in most of the patients. The twice-weekly regimen appeared to result in higher rates of grade > 3 AEs (79% VS 50%), grade 4 AEs (18% VS 11%), and discontinuations (38% vs 28%) and dose reductions (53% vs 22%) because of AEs than the once-weekly regimen. The studies indicate that bortezomib-based regimens, administered either once or twice weekly, are effective in treating various diseases, including multiple myeloma and lymphoma. The overall response rates and survival rates were generally high across all studies. However, the occurrence of adverse events, particularly peripheral neuropathy, was a common concern. The severity and frequency of these adverse events seemed to be lower with once-weekly administration schedules. Some studies suggested that modifying the treatment schedule or dose could improve patient outcomes and reduce toxicity. However, the optimal dosing schedule and dose intensity remain to be definitively established.\"\"\"\n",

        "#         \"input\": \"\"\"A total of 7 clinical studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of the CyBorD regimen for the treatment of AL amyloidosis and the key efficacy data is presented in Table 2. To date, the retrospective study by Palladini et al (2015) was the largest study on the efficacy of the CyBorD regimen for the treatment of AL amyloidosis in patients who were newly diagnosed. In this study, CyBorD was administered as a first-line therapy. The overall HR rate was 60% and a CR was observed in 23% of patients. After a median follow up of 25 months for living patients who completed a median of 4 cycles, cardiac and renal responses were obtained in 17% and 25% of patients, respectively. In patients with advanced cardiac disease (NT proBNP over 8,500 ng/L [Stage III]), a lower HR rate (42%) and CR (14%) was observed. This cohort also had a poorer survival (median: 7 months). Based upon these results the authors concluded that CyBorD achieved an excellent outcome in noncardiac patients with AL amyloidosis and the combination therapy can rescue subjects with reversible heart damage. Further, the outcome of high-risk patients remains poor, but response to CyBorD treatment can improve survival in this group. In addition to the study by Palladini et al (2015), six additional retrospective studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of the CyBorD regimen for the treatment of AL amyloidosis were presented in Section 3.1. Similar to Palladini et al (2015), 5 studies evaluated the safety and efficacy of the CyBorD regimen administered as a first-line therapy. In these studies, the CyBorD regimen was effective and well tolerated in newly diagnosed patients. Of note, Cornell et al (2015) evaluated the CyBorD regimen as a first-line therapy in patients who were SCT ineligible. In this study, although the patients numbers were small (n=28), the results showed that hematological and organ responses induced with the CyBorD regimen enabled 8 (33%) of the initially transplant ineligible patients to undergo autologous hematopoietic SCT, including 4 patients with cardiac Stage III or IV. Seven of the 8 patients (88%) who underwent subsequent autologous hematopoietic SCT achieved a sustained HR at a median of 33 months posttransplant. These data suggest that induction therapy with CyBorD, followed by autologous hematopoietic SCT is a viable therapeutic strategy for patients with transplant ineligible AL amyloidosis. Two studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of the CyBorD regimen as an induction therapy prior to SCT. Both studies found that the CyBorD regimen produced rapid and excellent HR in the majority of patients with AL amyloidosis, regardless of previous treatment or SCT candidacy. Of note, similar to the results from Cornell et al (2015), Mikhael et al (2012) observed that 3 patients originally not eligible for autologous SCT became eligible following treatment with the CyBorD regimen. In both studies, the regimen was well tolerated with few side effects. Based upon these efficacy and safety results, Abbas et al (2016) noted that the CyBorD regimen became the standard induction therapy within the Cleveland Clinic health care system.Across the 7 retrospective studies presented above, the dosage frequency for bortezomib was either once- or twice-weekly. The once-weekly bortezomib frequency was evaluated in 2 studies (Abbas et al [2016] and Cornell et al [2015]) and in both, this dosage frequency was very effective. Safety outcomes were not reported by Abbas et al (2016) and Cornell et al (2015) reported that the regimen was well tolerated with 2 out of 28 patients experiencing Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy toxicities. The twice-weekly bortezomib frequency, within the CyBorD regimen, was evaluated in 2 studies (Venner et al [2012 and 2014]). In both studies, the dosage frequency was very effective; however, only the 2012 study reported safety outcomes. In this study, 30% of the patients developed neuropathy, which resulted in discontinuation of therapy in 14%. Three studies (Mikhael et al [2012], Palladini et al [2015]; Shah et al [2013]) evaluated the effectiveness of both the weekly- and twice-weekly frequencies. Across all 3 studies, patients treated with either frequency showed treatment efficacy; however, treatment efficacy was not presented as a function of treatment frequency. Palladini et al (2015) reported that response rate was not affected by either twice- or once-weekly bortezomib treatment. In terms of safety outcomes, in this study, the most common severe AE was worsening heart failure in 8 patients (3%); 2 patients received 1.3 mg/m2 infusions twice weekly and 6 patients received the same dose once weekly. In both Mikhael et al (2012) and Shah et al (2013) no Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy toxicities occurred. Mikhael et al (2012) reported that 2 patients experienced a Grade 1 or 2 peripheral neuropathy and that the observed low toxicity may be due to the fact that the majority of patients received the weekly bortezomib treatment (15/17 patients) versus the twice-weekly treatment. Shah et al (2013) reported that 1 patient experienced Grade 3 diarrhea, and 2 patients developed Grade 3 thrombocytopenia that required dose reductions. Across 6 of the retrospective studies presented above (Mikhael et al [2012] did not report mode of bortezomib administration), bortezomib was administered as either an IV or SC dose. Bortezomib was administered as a SC dose in 2 studies (Abbas et al [2016] and Shah et al [2013]) and this mode of administration was associated with a high overall response rate. Shah et al (2013) noted that SC formulation was shown to be noninferior to the IV formulation in relapsed multiple myeloma settings. Safety outcomes were not reported by Abbas et al (2016) and Shah et al (2013), as noted above, reported that no Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathies occurred, whereas Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 1 patient and Grade 3 thrombocytopenia, which required dose reductions, occurred in 2 patients. Shah et al (2013) hypothesized that the observed minimal toxicity was due to SC administration of bortezomib. Bortezomib was administered as an IV dose in 3 studies (Cornell et al [2015], Venner et al [2012 and 2014]), which found that this mode of administration was also associated with a high overall response rate. In terms of safety outcomes, Cornell et al (2015) reported that 2/28 (7%) patients receiving bortezomib IV experienced Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy toxicities, Venner et al (2012) reported that 30% of patients developed neuropathy, which resulted in discontinuation of therapy in 14% of patients, and Venner et al (2014) did not report any safety outcomes. One study, Palladini et al (2015), evaluated the effectiveness of bortezomib administered as an IV or SC dose and reported that response rate was not affected by mode of administration. The analysis of safety data determined that AEs were more frequent, though not significantly, in patients who received IV bortezomib compared with those who received SC bortezomib (IV: 12% vs SC: 5%, p=0.093). Grade 2 neuropathy was observed in 6 patients, 4 of whom received IV bortezomib.\"\"\",\n",
        "#         \"actual_output\": \"\"\"The seven clinical studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of treatments such as Bortezomib, Cyclophosphamide, Dexamethasone, and Thalidomide, alone or in combination, in patients with AL amyloidosis and multiple myeloma, with a focus on overall survival, hematologic response, and progression-free survival. Five studies by Abbas et al (2016), Cornell et al (2015), Mikhael et al (2012), Palladini et al (2015), and Venner et al (2012) used a combination of Bortezomib, Cyclophosphamide and Dexamethasone, while Shah et al (2013) used subcutaneous Bortezomib. Venner et al (2014) compared Cyclophosphamide, Bortezomib and Dexamethasone (CVD) versus risk-adapted Cyclophosphamide, Thalidomide and Dexamethasone (CTD). Studies using a combination of Bortezomib, Cyclophosphamide and Dexamethasone, the combination of Bortezomib, Cyclophosphamide and Dexamethasone (CyBorD) was studied in a total of 318 patients across various studies. The overall survival rate was 92% when CyBorD was used in conjunction with ASCT, and 47% when used alone. The hematologic response rate varied between 60% and 94% across different studies. The treatment was generally well tolerated, with few side effects and no significant safety concerns, although some patients did experience severe adverse events or developed neuropathy (Abbas et al, 2016; Cornell et al, 2015; Mikhael et al, 2012; Palladini et al, 2015; Venner et al, 2012). In studies using subcutaneous Bortezomib, it was studied in a population of 29 patients with a median age of 66 years. The overall response rate was 93%. The treatment was generally safe, with no patients developing grade 3/4 peripheral neuropathy. However, one patient experienced grade 3 diarrhea, and two patients developed grade 3 thrombocytopenia requiring dose reductions (Shah et al, 2013). In studies using a comparison of Cyclophosphamide, Bortezomib and Dexamethasone (CVD) versus risk-adapted Cyclophosphamide, Thalidomide and Dexamethasone (CTD), it was studied in a population of 138 patients. The overall response rates were 71.0% for CVD and 79.7% for CTD. The complete response rate was higher for CVD (40.5%) than for CTD (24.6%). The one-year overall survival rates were similar for both treatments, but the median progression-free survival was significantly longer for CVD (28.0 months) than for CTD (14.0 months). The CTD treatment was challenging due to toxicities, leading to frequent dose adjustments and discontinuations (Venner et al, 2014). All studies concluded that the combination of cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (CyBorD) is an effective treatment for AL amyloidosis, with high overall response rates and improved survival rates. The treatment was well-tolerated with minimal toxicity, and it was noted that it could potentially allow for deferred stem cell transplantation in previously ineligible patients. However, some studies highlighted that despite the high response rates, both regimens were unable to overcome the high rate of early deaths in AL amyloidosis, indicating a need for further optimization and better supportive-care strategies.\"\"\"\n",

        "#         \"input\": \"\"\"The efficacy of flunarizine compared with placebo for migraine prophylaxis in adults was evaluated in 10 placebo-controlled studies in 453 subjects. Across these studies, subjects with common or classic migraine received treatment with flunarizine 10 mg daily or placebo for durations of 3 to 4 months. Seven of the studies showed a significant effect of flunarizine         compared with placebo in reducing the frequency of migraine attacks, and thus, support the efficacy of flunarizine in prophylaxis of migraine. Across the studies that reported effects on migraine severity and duration, most found no significant decreases in duration or severity of attack with flunarizine versus placebo except for the study by Mendenopoulous et al (1985), which showed a significant reduction in severity of attacks with flunarizine after 2 months of treatment and the study by Diamond and Schenbaum (1983), which showed significant decreases in HUIC (severity and duration) and PIR (pain intensity) indices with flunarizine administered for 12 weeks. Three studies failed to show a significant superiority of flunarizine compared with placebo, although a tendency towards significant differences was observed. This result is likely due the existence of a high placebo effect. Studies of prophylactic treatment of migraine have shown a high variability in the rate of placebo response, which may be due in part to the inherent variability in responses measured over a period of months. In the pooled analysis of 2 identical studies in a total of 143 evaluable subjects (JRD 14,950/002 and JRD 14,950/004), a significant difference in headache index was found between flunarizine and placebo after 1 month of treatment; however, differences in efficacy parameters were only marginally significant for flunarizine at the last visit. Al Deeb et al (1992) noted that baseline factors, including higher mean age, higher number of attacks, and greater number of classic versus common migraineurs in the flunarizine group, may have contributed to the lack of significant differences between the treatments. Thomas et al (1991) found no significant benefit with flunarizine compared with placebo in analysis of individual indices; however, comparison of median values of indices between the treatment groups showed that flunarizine provided statistically significant reductions in all headache indices from baseline and compared with placebo. The efficacy of flunarizine in migraine prophylaxis in adults was evaluated in 32 active-controlled studies in 6,246 subjects. Twelve studies compared flunarizine with beta-blockers including metoprolol, nadolol, and propranolol. Flunarizine was also compared with acupuncture, betahistine, methysergide, nifedipine, nimodipine, nimodipine plus Yufeng Ningxin, pizotifen, topiramate, valproate, Zhengtian capsules, and -DHEC. One study compared 2 different dosages of flunarizine (5 mg and 10 mg daily), 1 study compared conventional flunarizine to a bioequivalent matrix flunarizine formulation, and 1 study compared flunarizine monotherapy to flunarizine combined with tSNS and with tSNS alone. Across the studies that included propranolol as a comparator, all found that flunarizine was at least as effective as propranolol in the prevention of migraine attack in adults. One of these was a large Company-sponsored randomized, double-blind study (FLU-INT-5 [1999]) that included 808 subjects with migraine treated with flunarizine 5 or 10 mg once daily or propranolol 160 mg daily for a duration of 16 weeks. Flunarizine 10 mg was as effective as propranolol in all evaluated efficacy parameters. Flunarizine 5 mg was also as effective as propranolol in reducing mean attack frequency, but more subjects were assessed as responders (had ≥50% decrease in attack frequency) with propranolol. Verspeelt et al (1996) compared flunarizine, at doses of 10 mg/day in those <65 years of age and 5 mg/day in those >65 years of age, to propranolol 40 to 120 mg/day in 1,601 subjects with migraine; the treatment duration was 6 months. Both treatments were effective with no significant difference in the number of attacks or in general feeling of well-being; however, propranolol was superior to flunarizine for reduction in the severity of attacks. One of the reviewed studies concluded that flunarizine resulted in a statistically significant better response rate versus propranolol. Zhang et al (2002) reported that flunarizine 10 mg/day compared with propranolol 30 mg/day, each administered for 8 weeks,provided a significantly greater total response rate of 93% versus 71% with propranolol. Studies that evaluated flunarizine compared with metoprolol or nadolol reported that the treatments were equally effective in the prevention of migraine attacks. In the remaining studies, flunarizine was found to be at least as effective as acupuncture, betahistine,  methysergide,  nifedipine,  nimodipine,  pizotifen, topiramate, valproate, Zhengtian capsules, and -DHEC.  Several of these treatments have not received regulatory approval and are used off label for migraine prevention; additionally, some are no longer recommended in treatment guidelines. Topiramate and valproate, however, are considered first-line treatments for prevention of migraine. In a long-term, randomized study in 150 subjects with migraine with aura (classic) or without aura, flunarizine 5 mg/day reduced the number of migraine and headache days from 4.41.5/month at baseline to 2.5±1.1/month after 12 months of treatment compared with a reduction from 4.61.4/month to 2.60.9/month with topiramate 25 to 100 mg/day. A second randomized study using a flunarizine dose of 10 mg/day compared with topiramate 50 mg/day for 8 weeks in 62 subjects with chronic migraine found reductions from baseline in total headache days/2 weeks of -4.9 with flunarizine vs -2.3 with topiramate (p=0.012) and in total migraine days/2 weeks of -4.3 vs -1.4, respectively (p=0.001). In 2 nonrandomized studies of flunarizine compared with topiramate, similar response rates, defined as subjects with at least 50% reduction in migraine attacks, were observed with flunarizine 5 mg/day and topiramate 100 mg/day (Study 1: 75% vs 70%, respectively; Study 2: 67% vs 71%, respectively). In a randomized, double-open study with flunarizine 10 mg/day and valproate 1 g/day administered for 8 weeks in 44 subjects with migraine with or without aura, each treatment resulted in a significant reduction from baseline in the mean number of migraine attacks (from 4.4 to 1.8 with flunarizine vs 5.1 to 1.6 with valproate; p<0.01 within each group).  Mu et al (2018) reported that nimodipine (120 mg/day) plus Yufeng Ningxin was superior to flunarizine 10 mg/day in reducing the number of migraine days and in response rate after 7 weeks of treatment. However, this study had several limitations including an insufficient study duration of 7 weeks (it should have been at least 3 months for a critical evaluation), lack of a placebo arm or run-in period, and unclear randomization and blinding. Nimodipine has not been approved for migraine prophylaxis and additional use of the herbal remedy Yufeng Ningxin may have accounted for the rapid migraine relief in the nimodipine arm. The secondary endpoint of response rate should have been used as the primary endpoint. The 3 non-controlled, open-label studies in 2,527 subjects are supportive for the efficacy of flunarizine for migraine prophylaxis in adults. All showed significant reductions in headache frequency from baseline with flunarizine 5 to 10 mg/day administered over 12 to 20 weeks. A recently published meta-analysis by Stubberud et al (2019) included 25 placebo- or active-controlled studies with flunarizine for migraine prophylaxis. Twenty-three of the 25 studies in the analysis are also reviewed in this Clinical Overview; the remaining 2 studies evaluated flunarizine dosages outside of those recommended in the Vietnamese Package Insert and were therefore excluded from this Clinical Overview. Stubberud et al reported that flunarizine was superior to placebo, comparable to propranolol, metoprolol, sodium valproate, and topiramate, and superior to pizotifen in reducing migraine frequency. However, acupuncture treatment was superior to flunarizine in reducing migraine frequency, intensity, and drug consumption. The efficacy of flunarizine compared with placebo for migraine prophylaxis in children with classic or common migraine was evaluated in 2 placebo-controlled studies in 118 subjects. Flunarizine 5 mg/day for 12 weeks resulted in statistically significant decreases in migraine attack frequency from baseline. Additionally, comparison of migraine frequency at the end of study showed statistically significantly fewer migraines with flunarizine versus placebo. Treatment with flunarizine also produced significant reductions from baseline in the duration of migraine attacks. The efficacy of flunarizine for migraine prophylaxis in children was compared with topiramate,  propranolol, dihydroergotamine, amitriptyline, cyproheptadine, and acetylsalicylic acid across 5 active-controlled studies in 278 subjects.  The randomized, double-blind study by Lütschg and Vassella (1990) showed that 4-month treatment with flunarizine 5 to 10 mg/day or propranolol 30 to 120 mg/day produced similar reductions in the frequency of migraine attacks  (76.4% flunarizine vs 73.3% propranolol) in children with simple or classic migraine. However, flunarizine had no effect on the duration or intensity of migraine attacks, whereas propranolol showed a decrease in migraine intensity. Similarly, the 4-month, open-label, active-controlled study by Hirfanoglu et al (1987) in children with migraine with or without aura showed a 71.5% reduction in migraine frequency with flunarizine 5 to 10 mg/day; corresponding reductions with amitriptyline 0.5 mg/kg/day, cyproheptadine 0.2 mg/kg/day, and propranolol 10 to 40 mg/day were 80.1%, 78.8%, and 68.2%, respectively. The 6-month non-randomized comparator study by Topcu et al (2014) reported significant decreases in PedMIDAS scores with flunarizine 5 to 10 mg/day, topiramate 1 to 2 mg/kg/day, and propranolol 20 to 40 mg/day, although reductions with topiramate and propranolol were significantly greater compared with flunarizine. 56 Lastra Martinez et al (1990) found similar efficacy with flunarizine (10 mg/day) and dihydroergotamine (3 doses of 1.5 mg/day per week after Week 3) (79% and 87% subjects with improvement, respectively) in migraine frequency, intensity, and duration in children with classic or common migraine. In a prospective, double-blind study in children with classic or uncomplicated migraine, there were no significant differences between flunarizine 5 to 10 mg/day and acetylsalicylic acid 100 to 200 mg/day in reduction of migraine attack frequency or symptoms. An additional study compared the efficacy of flunarizine with flunarizine combined with behavioral therapy in 90 children with migraine. Flunarizine, at doses of 0.2 mg/kg/day up to 10 mg/day, administered for 3 months was found to be more effective when combined with behavioral therapy versus monotherapy, as shown by significantly lower PedMIDAS scores. Four non-controlled open-label studies in 263 subjects are supportive for the efficacy of flunarizine for prevention of migraine in children. An open-label study of flunarizine 10 mg/day administered for 8 weeks to 200 children and adolescents with migraine found a significant decrease in migraine attack frequency and severity. Boccia et al (2006) reported significantly decreased migraine frequency at 1 and 2 months after daily administration of flunarizine 5 mg in children with migraine.  Similarly, Guidetti reported in children with common or classic migraine a significant decrease in migraine frequency after 1 month of treatment with flunarizine 5 mg/day, which was maintained after 6 months of treatment. Visudtibhan et al (2004) found that 66.7% of children administered flunarizine 5 to 10 mg/day had a decrease in migraine frequency. Overall, the reviewed efficacy data from studies of flunarizine in adults and children with migraine support the authorized indication of flunarizine in Vietnam for the maintenance treatment of migraine, when other treatments are ineffective or poorly tolerated. Literature searches to identify relevant studies that support the efficacy and safety of flunarizine in the prevention of migraine in adults and children were performed as reported in Section 4. The available safety results from the reviewed studies are discussed in Section 5.1. The most frequently reported AEs across the placebo-controlled studies of flunarizine for migraine prophylaxis in adults were weight gain and sedation. In the pooled analysis of 2 identical studies in a total of 143 evaluable subjects (JRD 14,950/002 and JRD 14,950/004), there were significantly higher incidences of weight gain (p=0.00131) and depression (p=0.0344) with flunarizine compared with placebo.  Other reported AEs with flunarizine across the reviewed placebo-controlled studies in adults included fatigue, headache, pain, nausea, drowsiness, rhinitis, depression, tiredness, diarrhea, giddiness, galactorrhea, stomach complaints, difficultly sleeping, sleepiness, lethargy, decreased motivation, weight loss, muscle aches, dry mouth, and numbness and tingling in hands.   One SAE of chest pain was reported with flunarizine. The subject had bypass surgery and recovered without sequelae; no further details were reported on the case. One study by Mendenopoulos et al (1985)reported that no adverse reactions occurred and that no changes in body weight were observed with flunarizine. Results from the reviewed 32 active-controlled studies in 6,246 adults with migraine indicate a similar safety profile with flunarizine as observed in the placebo-controlled studies in adults. Across the reviewed studies, the most commonly reported AEs with flunarizine were somnolence, weight gain, fatigue, and drowsiness.  In the Company- sponsored study FLU-INT-5 in 808 subjects, the majority of AEs were mild or moderate in severity. 10 Six subjects reported SAEs; there were no cases of death or EPS. In the large postmarketing observational study in 1,601 subjects, the safety evaluation was focused on EPS and depression.  In those treated with flunarizine, 2 subjects reported EPS and 34 subjects reported depression. Non-controlled, open-label studies in 2,527 subjects reported drowsiness, asthenia, weight increase, fatigue, somnolence, appetite increase, and depression as the most commonly occurring AEs with flunarizine. The meta-analysis of 25 placebo- or active-controlled studies with flunarizine for migraine prophylaxis concluded that flunarizine was well tolerated. The reviewed studies provide evidence supporting the safety of flunarizine in children with migraine. Adverse events reported with flunarizine in 2 placebo-controlled studies with children included drowsiness, weight gain, GI complaints, and fatigue; there were no SAEs reported. Flunarizine had no effect on routine laboratory assessments, blood pressure, or electroencephalogram measurements. Adverse events with flunarizine across the 6 active-controlled studies included drowsiness, paresthesia, increased appetite, weight gain, increased fatigue, shortness of breath, concentration disorders, and stomach pain. No SAEs or cases of EPS were observed. No AEs were reported with flunarizine in non-controlled open-label studies. Overall, the safety data in adults and children in the reviewed studies are consistent with the known safety profile of flunarizine, as described in the current Vietnamese Package Insert.\"\"\",\n",
        "#         \"actual_output\": \"\"\"The ten studies reviewed primarily evaluate the effectiveness of flunarizine, either alone or in combination with other treatments such as propranolol, dihydroergotamine, and behavioral therapy, in managing migraine conditions in children. The research studies are categorized into five groups: Randomized Studies (Boccia et al, 2006; Chen et al, 2014; Martinez et al, 1990), Controlled Trials (Hirfanoglu et al, 2009; Topcu et al, 2014), Double-Blind Studies (Lutschg et al, 1990; Pothmann et al, 1987), Studies with Unspecified Design (Guidetti et al, 1987; Min et al, 2012), and a single Prospective Study (Visudtibhan et al, 2004). Each study is placed in the group that best represents its design without any repetition across groups. In randomized studies conducted by Boccia et al (2006), Chen et al (2014), and Martinez et al (1990) on a population range of 50-90 patients aged between 8.63-14 years, it was found that Flunarizine significantly decreased TGEt, abdominal pain, vomiting, and headache frequency. An unspecified treatment showed significant differences in PedMIDAS and improved Bussone headache index. Dihydroergotamine and flunarizine significantly improved frequency, intensity, and length of episodes. The studies reported no relevant side-effects with flunarizine and mild side effects with dihydroergotamine and flunarizine. In controlled trials conducted by Hirfanoglu et al (2009) and Topcu et al (2014) on a population range of 77-88 patients aged between 6-17 years, it was found that Cyproheptadine, amitriptyline, propranolol, and flunarizine decreased frequency, duration, and severity of headache, and the PedMIDAS score. Topiramate, propranolol, and flunarizine significantly decreased PedMIDASs and improved patients' quality of life. The studies reported no correlations between cytokine levels and the frequency, duration, and severity of headaches and the PedMIDAS score. However, Topiramate caused side effects such as dizziness, lack of attention, and palpitations. In double-blind studies conducted by Lutschg et al (1990) and Pothmann et al (1987) on a population range of 30-33 patients aged between 7-17 years, it was found that Flunarizine and propranolol reduced the number of migraine attacks. No significant differences were observed in the reduction of attack frequency or symptoms between acetylsalicylic acid (ASS) and Flunarizine. The studies reported temporary side effects in both flunarizine and propranolol groups and slight body weight gain or abdominal pain after intake. In studies with unspecified design conducted by Guidetti et al (1987) and Min et al (2012) on a population range of 13-200 patients aged between 10-13 years, it was found that Flunarizine significantly decreased attack frequency and degree of headache after therapy. The studies reported no significant interference with pituitary, beta-pancreatic, or gonadal function, and no significant differences in the serum concentrations of various hormones before and after treatment. Flunarizine for migraine prophylactic treatment was found to be effective and safe. In a prospective study conducted by Visudtibhan et al (2004) on an unspecified number of patients aged between 7-15 years, it was found that Flunarizine showed improvement in 66% of the patients, including 13 of 14 patients who received 5-mg daily and 1 of 7 patients who received 10 mg daily. Furthermore, 23% of the patients had no recurrent attack, and 42% had more than a 50% reduction in the frequency of migraine. The study reported no adverse effects. All studies concluded that flunarizine is effective in reducing the frequency and severity of migraines in children. Some studies also found that flunarizine improved gastrointestinal symptoms associated with migraines. The drug was generally well-tolerated, with few side effects reported. However, one study found that flunarizine was less effective than topiramate and propranolol in reducing the frequency of migraines, while another study found that flunarizine was less effective in children with vegetative lability. Some studies also found that flunarizine had no effect on the duration of migraines. Overall, the studies suggest that flunarizine is a safe and effective treatment for migraines in children, but its effectiveness may vary depending on the individual characteristics of the patient.\"\"\"\n",

        "#         \"input\": \"\"\"A review of the clinical studies evaluating the use of miconazole nitrate and hydrocortisone cream in the treatment of skin infections due to dermatophytes or Candida species was conducted. Of the total 8 publications, 3 were randomized, double\u0002blind, active-controlled studies (Björnberg and Tegner, 1986; Taplin, 1976; Mertens et al, 1976). The sample sizes across the included studies varied from 19 subjects to 157 subjects. Efficacy results from the 2 randomized, double-blind studies comparing miconazole-hydrocortisone cream with the individual components (Mertens et al, 1976; Taplin, 1976) showed that nearly all subjects treated with miconazole-hydrocortisone or miconazole alone were negative for fungus or dermatophytes by the end of treatment (28/28 subjects in the study by Mertens and 65/66 subjects in the study by Taplin were negative) compared with a small proportion of subjects treated with hydrocortisone alone (2/13 subjects in the study by Mertens and 4/33 subjects in the study by Taplin). The randomized, double-blind study comparing miconazole-hydrocortisone cream with miconazole cream (Björnberg and Tegner, 1986) showed that clinical response to miconazole-hydrocortisone was significantly better compared with miconazole alone (21/24 subjects clinically cured with miconazole-hydrocortisone versus 11/24 subjects with miconazole alone). Results from the open-label, single-arm studies are supportive for the efficacy of miconazole-hydrocortisone with the 2 largest of these studies in 157 and 107 subjects (Aussems and Van Cutsem, 1974; Clinical Research Report R 14 899/1 NL, 1985) showing clinical cure rates of 89% and 91%, respectively, in dermatophyte or yeast infections.\"\"\",\n",
        "#         \"actual_output\": \"\"\"The eight clinical studies are evaluating the effectiveness of miconazole nitrate and hydrocortisone treatment in various skin conditions such as mycotic lesions, tinea cruris, tinea pedis, dermatomycoses, and inflammatory skin infections of bacterial or mycotic origin. Aussems and Cutsem (1974) studied mycotic lesions of the skin. Tinea cruris and tinea pedis were the focus of Bjonberg et al (1986) and Taplin et al (1976). The Clinical Progress Report (1971) examined skin or nail lesions of apparent mycotic origin, while the Clinical Research Report (1985) looked into various dermatomycoses. Inflamed skin infections of bacterial or mycotic origin were researched by Clinical Progress Reports (1973) and Boar et al (1980). Taplin et al (1976) also studied acute, moderate to severe symptomatic tinea corporis and tinea cruris. Lastly, inflamed skin infections were the subject of Mertens et al (1976). Mycotic lesions of the skin were studied by Aussems and Cutsem (1974) on a population range of 157 patients aged between four days to ten years, resulting in a cure rate of 83% after a median treatment duration of 4 weeks, with only one patient reporting adverse reactions. Tinea cruris and tinea pedis were examined by Bjonberg et al (1986) and Taplin et al (1976) on a combined population of 125 patients aged between 16 to 65 years and 18 to 28 years respectively, with a cure rate of 21/26 lesions within one month with the combination treatment, and no side effects reported in both studies. Skin or nail lesions of apparent mycotic origin were investigated in a Clinical Progress Report (1971) on 30 out-patients aged between 6-68 years, with 21 patients completely cured after one to four weeks. Various dermatomycoses were studied in a Clinical Research Report (1985) on 107 patients aged between 1 and 77 years, with a cure rate of 95.3% and no reported side effects. Inflamed skin infections of bacterial or mycotic origin were examined by Clinical Progress Reports (1973) and Boar et al (1980) on a combined population of 55 patients aged between 8 and 87 years and 17 and 59 years respectively, with a cure rate of 97% and 95% respectively, and no side effects reported in both studies. Acute, moderate to severe symptomatic tinea corporis and tinea cruris were studied by Taplin et al (1976) on 99 male patients aged between 18 and 28 years, with the combination treatment proving superior to Miconazole alone. Inflamed skin infections were investigated by Mertens et al (1976) on 63 patients with a median age of 30 years, with all patients in the Daktacort and miconazole groups testing negative for fungi at the end of the trial, and the Daktacort and miconazole treatments proving significantly superior to hydrocortisone. All studies concluded that miconazole cream is effective in treating various types of cutaneous mycoses, with high cure rates and good tolerability reported. However, some studies found that other treatments, such as sertaconazole and eberconazole, showed superior efficacy in certain conditions or provided a quicker onset of action. A few studies reported that miconazole was not fully effective in treating tinea capitis or was less well-tolerated due to the smell of the formulation. No serious adverse effects were reported in any of the studies.\"\"\"\n",

Of these, 4 were single-arm studies, 10 described randomized, controlled studies, 1 was a nonrandomized comparative study, 1 was a nonrandomized controlled study, and 1 was a randomized comparison of 2 different dosage regimens of miconazole nitrate cream. The 17 studies showed that miconazole nitrate cream is an effective treatment for the indications specified in the CCDS (August 2015), as evidenced by improvements in clinical signs and symptoms and high rates of mycologic cure after completion of treatment. In a pooled analysis (Clinical Progress Report R 14 889/48, 1973) of 7 randomized, placebo-controlled studies in 488 efficacy-evaluable subjects with superficial cutaneous dermatophyte and yeast infections, excellent to good response was achieved by 78.4% subjects treated with miconazole 2% cream compared with 21% of subjects who received placebo. In the 2 largest randomized, double-blind, active-controlled studies with miconazole 2% cream, efficacy rates were similar between miconazole 2% cream and eberconazole 1% cream (Repiso Montero et al, 2006) and between miconazole 2% cream and sertaconazole 2% cream (Alomar et al, 1992). In 360 subjects with dermatophyte infections, Repiso Montero et al (2006) showed clinical efficacy (effective response rate) of 75.0% with miconazole and 76.1% with eberconazole. The mycologic cure rates were 84.1% with miconazole and 87.0% with eberconazole. In 569 evaluable subjects with superficial infections of mycotic etiology, Alomar et al (1992) showed similar results in end-of-study (7 days after the end of treatment) negative KOH microscopic examination rates between miconazole and sertaconazole (95.7% with miconazole and 98.0% with sertaconazole); however, the rates of negative cultures were significantly different between treatments (91.7% with miconazole and 98.6% with sertaconazole, p<0.0001). The data presented support the indications of miconazole nitrate cream to treat skin infections due to dermatophytes or yeasts, and other fungi as specified in the CCDS (August 2015).\"\"\",\n",
        "#         \"actual_output\": \"\"\"4The 16 clinical studies are evaluating the efficacy and safety of various treatments, including miconazole, sertaconazole, and Daktarin cream, in managing different fungal skin conditions such as superficial cutaneous mycosis, erythrasma, superficial fungal infections of the skin, tinea capitis, tinea pedis, and cutaneous dermatophytosis. Alomar et al (1992) and a Clinical Research Report (1987) have both conducted studies on superficial cutaneous mycosis. Research on superficial fungal infections of the skin and erythrasma has been carried out by Clayton et al (1979), a Clinical Research Report (1973), and Dogliotti et al (1977). Duncan et al (1975), Edwards et al (1978), and Ortiz et al (1978) have all contributed to the study of tinea pedis and tinea versicolor. Dermatophytoses have been studied by Ghaninejad et al (2009), Nolting et al (1995), Repiso Montero et al (2006), and Sharma et al (2011). Manohar et al (1976) and Mulay et al (1975) have researched dermatophytoses, candidiasis of skin, and tinea versicolor. Lastly, research on tinea capitis has been conducted by Shetsiruli et al (1974) and Wright et al (1986). Superficial cutaneous mycosis was studied in a population range of 631 patients aged between 18 and 70 years, with a cure rate of 95.6% for Sertaconazole, 88% for Miconazole, 84.8% for Daktarin cream once daily, and 88.6% for Daktarin cream twice daily. Both drugs demonstrated excellent safety, with no systemic adverse effects reported (Alomar et al, 1992; Clinical Research Report, 1987). Superficial fungal infections of the skin and erythrasma were studied in a population range of 112 patients aged between 18 and 70 years, and 525 patients in seven well-controlled studies. The incidence of side effects was significantly higher in the haloprogin group, but the cream preparation containing 2.0 percent miconazole nitrate was significantly more effective than the placebo cream (Clayton et al, 1979; Clinical Research Report, 1973). Superficial cutaneous dermatophyte and yeast infections were studied in a population range of 79 black children aged between 2 to 12 years, with both agents being well tolerated, indicating good safety results (Dogliotti et al, 1977). Tinea pedis and tinea versicolor were studied in a population range of 105 healthy men aged between 19 to 46 years, 329 patients, 100 patients with tinea pedis and 50 patients with tinea versicolor, with a cure rate of 63% for the Miconazole group, 18% for the Control group, an average symptom cure rate of 79%, 90% for tinea pedis, and 100% for tinea versicolor. No adverse effects were noted in either treatment group (Duncan et al, 1975; Edwards et al, 1978; Ortiz et al, 1978). Dermatophytosis was studied in a population range of 100 adults aged over 18 years, 653 patients aged 18 years or over, and 260 patients aged between 18-70 years, with a significantly higher cure rate for Sertaconazole by day 15, 76.1% for Eberconazole, 75.0% for Miconazole, and 62.3% for Sertaconazole. Both drugs were well tolerated and the adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and disappeared with continued therapy (Ghaninejad et al, 2009; Repiso Montero et al, 2006; Sharma et al, 2011). Dermatophytoses, candidiasis of skin, and tinea versicolor were studied in a population range of 116 patients aged between 16-45 years, and 105 patients, with a cure rate of 94.6% and 66% respectively. The study reported no adverse side effects with the use of miconazole cream (Manohar et al, 1976; Mulay et al, 1975). Dermatophytoses were studied in a population range of 214 outpatients aged between 12 and 95 years, with no adverse events reported by the patients during treatment with either the combination or the miconazole monopreparation (Nolting et al, 1995). Tinea capitis was studied in a population range of 138 patients, with a cure rate of 90% (Shetsiruli et al, 1974). All studies concluded that miconazole cream is effective in treating various types of cutaneous mycoses, with high cure rates and good tolerability. However, some studies found that other treatments, such as sertaconazole and eberconazole, showed superior efficacy in certain conditions or had a faster onset of action. A few studies reported that miconazole was not fully effective in treating tinea capitis or that it was less well tolerated than other treatments. All studies reported excellent safety profiles for miconazole, with few or no adverse effects reported.\"\"\"\n",

In the publications by Stein Gold et al (2019), Treesirichod et al (2019), and Asawaworarit et al  (2017), subjects up to 18 or 19 years old were included; since this was the upper end of the age ranges for patients included in these publications, it was considered appropriate to include data from these studies in this review. Data from the publication by Abdlkadhim et al (2019) included subjects up to 23 years old, but since 69.6% of these subjects were aged 3 to 15 years, it was considered appropriate to include data from this study in this review. In the 12 publications describing the use of tretinoin to treat dermatological condition (ie, acne, molluscum contagiosum, acanthosis nigricans, plane warts, and striae alba), tretinoin was administered topically, usually once nightly and as a lotion, gel, or cream formulation, in doses of 0.025 mg, 0.05 mg, or 0.1 mg. Treatment duration was 6 weeks in the study in molluscum contagiosum, 8 weeks in the study in acanthosis nigricans and in the study in plane warts, 12 weeks in all the acne studies, except 1 where treatment duration ranged from 7 to 10 weeks, and 16 weeks in the study in striae alba. In the 3 studies in which tretinoin was used to treat a non-dermatological condition (APL), treatment duration was not specified, but a tretinoin dosage of 25 mg/m2 was used in 2 of these studies. Tretinoin treatment was found to be effective in the treatment of subjects aged <18 years with acne. Four post hoc analyses of the same 2 large Phase 3 studies in subjects with moderate-to-severe acne showed that tretinoin 0.05% lotion was effective in the treatment of preadolescents and adolescents aged <18 years, as demonstrated by statistically significant reductions in both inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts (Eichenfield 2019; Kircik 2019; St. Surin-Lord 2019; Stein Gold 2019). The prospective study by Ohlson et al (2019) which included 32 subjects aged <18 years showed that a combination of clindamycin phosphate 1.2% and tretinoin 0.025% resulted in a significant reduction in the mean VAS scores for acne severity and also improved quality of life after 12 weeks of treatment. In the prospective, randomized study by Coughlin et al (2017) in children aged 7 to 10 years with acne, treatment with tretinoin 0.025% cream in 3 subjects significantly decreased the alpha diversity of the skin microbiome to levels similar to those in children without acne. The pooled analysis of 3 Phase 3 studies by Dréno et al (2014), which included 2,915 adolescents aged 11 to 17 years,  showed that the clindamycin/tretinoin combination was significantly more effective than clindamycin, tretinoin, and vehicle in terms of the median percentage change from baseline to Week 12 in inflammatory, noninflammatory, and total lesions. The efficacy of tretinoin in the treatment of pediatric subjects with APL was described in 3 studies. In the retrospective study by Garcia-Spezza et al (2020), 21 subjects aged 1 to 16 years received a combination of ATO-ATRA during the induction therapy (high-risk subjects had idarubicin 12 mg/m2 added at Days 1 and 3). All subjects achieved cytological remission during the induction therapy after a median of 34 days of treatment and molecular remission after a median of 8 weeks. In the retrospective study by Creutzig et al (2017), 11 subjects aged 1 to 17 years received a combination of ATO-ATRA. All subjects achieved molecular remission after a median of 10 weeks (range, 7-20 weeks) and were still in remission after a median follow-up of 2.4 years (range:1.0-3.8 years). In the retrospective study by Panda et al (2014), of 37 evaluable subjects aged 2 to 14 years who received induction therapy with a combination of ATO-ATRA, 33 subjects (89.2%) achieved complete remission (the remaining 4 subjects died). Tretinoin 0.05% cream was shown to be effective for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum in the cohort study by Abdlkadhim et al (2019) conducted in 23 subjects (69.6% aged 3 to <15 years), all treated with tretinoin. A significant reduction in the mean number of lesions was observed (8.65 [±3.20] at baseline to 0.87 [±1.46] after 6 weeks of treatment), with a cure rate of 65.2% (15/23 subjects with no lesions after treatment). Tretinoin 0.025% cream was effective in the treatment of acanthosis nigricans in the double-blind, randomized study by Treesirichod et al (2019) conducted in 20 subjects aged 12 to 18 years, all treated with tretinoin. A statistically significant difference in the mean M indices was observed after 8 weeks of treatment compared with baseline (140.0; 23.8±8.3% improvement). Tretinoin 0.05% lotion was effective in the treatment of plane warts in the randomized study by El-Refaei and EL-Rahman (2015) conducted in 90 subjects; of whom 45 were treated with tretinoin (aged 7 to 32 years). A statistically significant reduction compared with baseline in the number of treated lesions was observed (54.05%). In the subgroup of subjects aged ≤10 years, tretinoin treatment resulted in a statistically significant higher percentage of improvement (75.5%) compared with subjects ≤10 years treated with 50% citric acid. Tretinoin 0.1% cream was effective in the treatment of striae alba in the randomized, double-blind study by Asawaworarit et al (2017) conducted in 48 subjects aged 10 to 19 years; of whom 39 completed the study (including 19 subjects treated with tretinoin; mean age: 18.86 years). Statistically significant reductions from baseline in the mean width (by 9.01%) and length (by 9.54%) of the lesions was observed after 16 weeks of treatment. Across all studies reviewed in this document, tretinoin appeared to be generally well tolerated with a favorable safety profile.\"\"\",\n",
        "#         \"actual_output\": \"\"\"The 15 studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of various topical treatments, including 0.05% topical retin-A, herbal extract cream, benzoyl peroxide 5% gel or cream, tretinoin 0.025% cream, all-trans retinoid acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO), clindamycin phosphate 1.2%/tretinoin 0.025% formulation, tretinoin 0.05% lotion, and 0.1% adapalene gel, in treating a range of dermatological conditions such as molluscum contagiosum, striae alba, acne, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), plane warts, and acanthosis nigricans. The studies are grouped into eight categories with varying counts: Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Vehicle-Controlled, Parallel-Group Studies (6 studies by Dreno et al, 2017; Eichenfield et al, 2017 and 2019; Kircik et al, 2019; Lord et al, 2019; Stein et al, 2019), Randomized, Double-Blind, Parallel-Group, Phase III Studies (1 study by Dreno et al, 2014), Retrospective Studies (2 studies by Creutzig et al, 2017; Spezza et al, 2019), Randomized Comparative Therapeutic Study (1 study by Refaei et al, 2015), Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Study (1 study by Harper et al, 2020), Prospective, Non-Interventional Study (1 study by Ohlson et al, 2019), Genetic and Metabolic Determinants Study (1 study by Panda et al, 2014), and 8-Week, Double-Blind, Randomized, Split-Neck Trial (1 study by Treesirichod et al, 2019). In a series of multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group studies conducted by Dreno et al (2017), Eichenfield et al (2017, 2019), Kircik et al (2019), Lord et al (2019), and Stein et al (2019), a diverse population ranging from less than 13 years to over 30 years old and totaling between 154 to 909 subjects was analyzed. The studies found that Tretinoin 0.05% lotion significantly reduced both inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts, with 23.6% of female subjects achieving treatment success by week 12. Most adverse events were mild and transient, primarily consisting of application site pain and dryness. In a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, Phase III study conducted by Dreno et al (2014) on a population of 4550 patients, Clin-RA was found to result in a significantly greater reduction in all types of lesions and a higher treatment success rate compared to clindamycin, tretinoin, and vehicle alone. The frequencies of adverse events in the active and vehicle groups were similar. In retrospective studies conducted by Creutzig et al (2017) and Spezza et al (2019) on a population of 11 to 21 patients aged between 1 and 17 years, all patients achieved molecular remission after 7-20 weeks of treatment with All-trans Retinoic Acid (ATRA) and Arsenic Trioxide (ATO). The overall survival (os) and relapse-free survival (RFS) rates after a mean follow-up of 17 [7; 56] months were 100%. The main complication was the differentiation syndrome, with 52.4% of patients complaining of significant headaches (grade 2), 14.3% exhibiting papillary oedema, suggestive of pseudotumor cerebri, linked to ATRA, and 9.5% showing grade 1 QTc prolongation during induction therapy. In a randomized comparative therapeutic study conducted by Refaei et al (2015) on a population of 90 patients aged between 7 and 34 years, there was a statistically significant difference (P<0.001) between the number of lesions before and after treatment in both groups. The total number of cleared lesions was 804 (56.4%) and 621 (43.6%) in groups I and II, respectively, with a statistically significant difference (P = 0.001). Side effects related to treatment were found in 68.4% and 31.6% in groups I and II, respectively, with patients experiencing a burning sensation. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study conducted by Harper et al (2020) on a population of 1640 patients aged between 9 and 58 years, Tretinoin 0.05% lotion improved signs and symptoms of cutaneous safety and tolerability, with progressive improvement in baseline erythema and itching over 12 weeks. 23.5% of patients reported treatment-emergent adverse events following daily treatment with tretinoin 0.05% lotion. Most common treatment-related adverse events included application site reactions of pain (3.1%), dryness (3.7%) and erythema (1.4%). In a prospective, non-interventional study conducted by Ohlson et al (2019) on a population of 84 patients, patient-assessed VAS scores for acne severity decreased continuously during the study, with the median percentage reduction from baseline for VAS score being 17.6% at week 4 and 63.8% at week 12. No serious adverse drug reactions were reported. A total of three ADRs were reported, occurring in two patients (2.4%). In a genetic and metabolic determinants study conducted by Panda et al (2014) on a population of 53 infants, the vaccine elicited an antibody IgM and/or IgG response directed to NGcGM3 in 9 patients, and IgM against racotumomab in 11 of 13 evaluable patients. However, no antitumor activity was evident in any patient. Most common local side effects included grade 1 erythema, induration, and local mild pain at the injection site. During induction, 5 developed differentiation syndrome, 1 pulmonary bleed, 2 fungal pneumonia, 2 asymptomatic QT prolongation. In an 8-week, double-blind, randomized, split-neck trial conducted by Treesirichod et al (2019) on a population of 20 participants aged between 12 and 18 years, there was no statistically significant difference between 0.1% adapalene gel and 0.025% tretinoin cream in the treatment of AN-associated hyperpigmentation. Both topical 0.1% adapalene and 0.025% tretinoin were tolerated well by the participants, with all participants experiencing mild cutaneous irritation from both medications during the first 2 weeks, which gradually improved by the end of the study. All studies concluded that topical tretinoin treatments were effective in reducing various skin conditions such as acne, molluscum contagiosum, and plane warts. The treatments were generally well-tolerated with mild and transient side effects. However, some studies noted that tretinoin treatments were more effective in adult females and that there were age-related efficacy benefits. Additionally, a few studies highlighted the potential of alternative treatments such as herbal extract cream and citric acid solution, which showed comparable efficacy to tretinoin treatments with fewer side effects.\"\"\"\n",

        "#         # \"actual_output\": \"\"\"The 16 studies reviewed evaluate the association between the use of various antipsychotic treatments, including atypical antipsychotics, prolactin-elevating antipsychotics, and dopamine antagonists, and the risk of developing breast cancer and other conditions such as schizophrenia, gynecological pathologies, and other types of cancer. The text data presents a classification of various studies into nine groups based on their design, including four retrospective studies (AZOULAY et al, 2011; Kanhouwa et al, 1984; Overall et al, 1978; WANG et al, 2002), three case-control studies (Bilici et al, 2011; Kelly et al, 1999; Pottegard et al, 2018), three population-based cohort studies (Dalton et al, 2006; Gray et al, 1991; Wu Chou et al, 2017), and one each of follow-up study (Danielson et al, 1982), time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models (Hicks et al, 2020), population-based, nested, case-control study (Hippisley et al, 2007), cohort study (Mortensen et al, 1987), observational cohort study (Rahman et al, 2021), and nested case-control study (Taipale et al, 2021). In a series of retrospective studies, a diverse population of female patients was analyzed, ranging from 93 to 106,362 individuals, including all women 40 years of age or younger, and 52,819 women exposed and 55,289 not exposed to dopamine antagonists. The studies found that atypical antipsychotics do not increase the risk of breast cancer compared to typical antipsychotics (AZOULAY et al, 2011), and there was no significant difference in the incidence of breast cancer between patients receiving phenothiazines and those that did not (Kanhouwa et al, 1984). Furthermore, only 5 (1.33%) of the patients had a prior psychiatric diagnosis (Overall et al, 1978), and the use of antipsychotic dopamine antagonists was associated with a 16% increase in the risk of breast cancer (WANG et al, 2002). In terms of safety, no increased risk was observed with antipsychotics known to increase prolactin levels, and the increased risk of breast cancer among dopamine antagonist users was not explained by increased surveillance or protopathic bias. However, elevated prolactin levels resulting in breast engorgement and lactation are common side effects of neuroleptic drugs (Kanhouwa et al, 1984). The risk of breast cancer should not be a major consideration in the clinical use of psychotherapeutic drugs (Overall et al, 1978). In a series of case-control studies, a diverse population was analyzed, including 136 inpatients, 140 women, 5,814 women with primary breast cancer, 5,095 women with primary malignancies of other sites, 5,814 women with other conditions, and 60,360 histologically verified breast cancer cases. The studies found that PRL levels between the groups were significantly different (Bilici et al, 2011), and there was no overall association between the use of antidepressants, phenothiazines, or antihistamines and breast cancer (Kelly et al, 1999). However, long-term use (>10000 mg olanzapine equivalents) was associated with breast cancer (Pottegard et al, 2018). In terms of safety, antipsychotic use did not affect the bone mineral density in regularly menstruating women, regardless of their PRL levels in this study population (Bilici et al, 2011). Some antidepressants caused increased growth of mammary tumors (Kelly et al, 1999), and long-term use was associated with breast cancer (Pottegard et al, 2018). The same pattern can be followed for the remaining group titles. The studies indicate that the use of antipsychotic drugs, particularly those that increase prolactin levels, may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in women. However, the risk is not significantly high and varies depending on the duration and dosage of the drug use. Some studies found no significant association between antipsychotic use and breast cancer risk, suggesting that other factors such as lifestyle choices, obesity, and hormone therapy may also play a role. Therefore, while antipsychotic use may contribute to breast cancer risk, it should not deter the clinical use of these drugs, and regular breast cancer screening is recommended for women taking these medications.\"\"\"\n",

        "#         \"input\":\"\"\"According to the most recent treatment guidelines described in Section 1.1, benznidazole and nifurtimox are the 2 only approved drugs for the treatment of Chagas disease. Both drugs are almost 100% effective if given during the acute phase; however, the cure rates decreased in the chronic phase (reported at 8-20% by Sales et al, 2017 and 10-20% by Bonney, 2014). It is estimated that approximately 30% to 40% of asymptomatic carriers will develop chronic Chagas disease. Both drugs present side effects that might lead to treatment discontinuation before the end of the entire treatment course and, therefore, affect their efficacy. Over the last decades, investigations were performed to identify more suitable therapeutic agents for the treatment of Chagas disease (see Section 1.2). Itraconazole was part of these investigations. The review of the literature identified 12 articles describing the use of itraconazole for the treatment of Chagas disease in humans. A series of publications by Apt et al (in 1998, 2003, 2005, and 2013) and Sánchez et al (2005) demonstrated the efficacy of itraconazole 6 mg/kg/day for 120 days in the treatment of chronic Chagas disease. In the study from Apt et al (1998), see Section 2.2.1.1, 404 subjects with chronic Chagas disease were treated with itraconazole 6 mg/kg/day (n=135) for 120 days, allopurinol 8.5 mg/kg/day (n=104) for 60 days, or placebo (n=165) for 60 days (these subjects were then randomized to itraconazole [n=82] or allopurinol [n=83]). Subjects were monitored over a period of 4 years by clinical examination, serology, XD, hemoculture, and ECG. Drug tolerance was good, with only 4 treatments discontinued due to side effects that subsided after suspension of treatment. Parasitologic cure was evident in 44% of the those treated with allopurinol and 53% of those treated with itraconazole, and the electrocardiographic evaluation showed normalization in 36.5% and 48.2 %, respectively, of subjects with chronic or recent cardiopathy. The study from Apt et al (2003), see Section 2.2.1.1, was the long-term follow-up (9 years) of subjects with chronic Chagas disease originally treated with itraconazole or allopurinol in the study from Apt et al (1998). The ECG changes in 299 cases of chronic Chagas disease were followed for 9 years after treatment with itraconazole (136) or allopurinol (163). Among the 97 cases who were found to have ECG abnormalities immediately before therapy, the 2 drugs appeared equally effective (abnormalities being corrected in 50% of the cardiopathy cases given itraconazole and 49% of the cases given allopurinol, compared with 8.1% frequency of abnormal–normal conversion observed among 198 historical controls). Itraconazole appeared better than allopurinol at preventing the development of cardiopathy in the cases who appeared electrocardiographically normal at baseline. Among 202 such cases, only 2.2% of the 90 itraconazole-treated cases compared with 25.0% of the 112 allopurinol-treated cases were found to have developed ECG abnormalities during follow-up. The authors concluded that although itraconazole and allopurinol were equally effective at reversing ECG alterations, itraconazole offered better protection against the development of new ECG abnormalities among those with chronic Chagas disease. The study from Apt et al (2005), see Section 2.2.1.1, reported results after 11 years of follow-up of subjects treated with itraconazole or allopurinol in the study from Apt et al (1998). A total of 109 subjects were checked for electrocardiographic abnormalities and evidence of T. cruzi infection. For the data analysis, the subjects were divided into 4 groups known as normal/normal, abnormal/normal, normal/abnormal and abnormal/abnormal, according to whether the subjects were found to have normal or abnormal ECG shortly before the first treatment and to have normal or abnormal ECG when checked at the 11-year follow-up. When checked 11 years posttreatment, 78.4%, 70.8%, 87.5%, and 94.4% of these subjects, respectively, were each found positive for T. cruzi in at least 1 of the parasitological tests. Only the 21 subjects who appeared to be negative for T. cruzi could be considered parasitologically cured. Only 13 of these parasitologically cured subjects (7 treated with itraconazole and 6 with allopurinol) had normal ECG at the 11-year follow-up. The authors concluded that, in Chile, itraconazole caused fewer adverse effects than allopurinol while being no less effective at preventing cardiopathy and appeared to be the drug of choice to treat chronic Chagas disease in adults. The study from Apt et al (2013), see Section 2.2.1, reported the results after 20 years of follow-up of 46 subjects with chronic Chagas disease originally treated with itraconazole in the study from Apt et al (1998). Twenty-one subjects proved to be uninfected after 20 years and 15 of the subjects had a normal ECG. Of the latter cases, 32.6% could be considered cured, although all of them had positive serology. Itraconazole prevented the development of ECG abnormalities with only 10.86% of subjects who developed ECG abnormalities after 20 years of follow-up. The authors concluded that itraconazole was useful in the treatment of chronic Chagas disease as it prevented the development of ECG abnormalities and cured 32.6% of subjects. The study from Sánchez et al (2005), see Section 2.2.1.5, reported the results after 10 years of follow-up of 54 subjects with chronic Chagas disease originally treated with itraconazole (n=23) or allopurinol (n=31) in the study from Apt et al (1998). All patients maintained positive conventional serology as determined by 2 methods. Twenty-five subjects showed positive XD (allopurinol, n=11 and itraconazole, n=14) and 29 negative XD (allopurinol, n=20 and itraconazole, n=9). Forty-three subjects were positive by both PCR and FC-ALTA (allopurinol, n=23 and itraconazole, n=20). Seven of the 54 subjects were negative by PCR and positive by FC-ALTA and 3 of 54 were positive by PCR and negative by FC-ALTA. Only 1 subject with both tests negative should be considered cured. Of 29 patients with negative XD, 14 treated with allopurinol (70 %) and 9 with itraconazole (77.8 %) showed positive PCR and FC-ALTA. These results did not show differences of efficacy among the 2 drugs. The study from Coronado et al (2006), see Section 2.2.4, evaluated the distribution of T. cruzi clones 12 years after completion of therapy with itraconazole in 17 subjects (6 mg/kg/day for 120 days). In the itraconazole-treated group, a lower percentage of clone TcIIb and a higher percentage of clone TcI was detected as compared with the control group, suggesting susceptibility and resistance to the drug, respectively. The authors concluded that the appropriate drug or drugs to treat patients should depend upon the infective T. cruzi clone or mixture of T. cruzi clones present. In the study from Zulantay et al (2004), see Section 2.2.5, 26 subjects with chronic Chagas disease who were treated with itraconazole (6 mg/kg/day for 120 days) were evaluated 6 years after completion of treatment to assess the usefulness of PCR and hybridization to monitor parasite clearance. The subjects assessed in this study originated from the pool of subjects part of the study reported by Apt et al (2003). Of the 15 negative XD cases after treatment with itraconazole, T. cruzi DNA was detected both by PCR and by hybridization test in 6 cases; 3 cases were negative by PCR but positive by hybridization test. Of the 11 positive XD cases after treatment with itraconazole, 9 cases were positive both by PCR and by hybridization test. In the study from Sánchez et al (1995), see Section 2.2.7, 35 subjects with chronic Chagas disease were treated with itraconazole 6 mg/kg/day for 120 days. Of the 17 subjects with positive XD before treatment, 12% were still positive after treatment. Treatment with itraconazole resulted in a significant reduction in the number of positive XD, indicating a decrease, or perhaps in some cases an elimination of the infection. In the study from Venegas et al (1997), see Section 2.2.6, 20 subjects with chronic Chagas disease were treated with itraconazole 6 mg/kg/day for 120 days and followed up for an average time of 43 months after treatment. Of the10 subjects with positive XD at baseline, sera from 6 displayed lytic activity against T. cruzi, which was maintained for 36 months (1 of these 6 subjects had negative lytic activity at 41 months of follow-up). Of the 10 subjects with negative XD at baseline, sera from 8 displayed lytic activity. At the end of the follow-up period, 7 of them became negative.\"\"\",\n",
        "#         \"actual_output\": \"\"\"The eight studies reviewed evaluated the efficacy of itraconazole and allopurinol in treating chronic Chagas' disease and chronic American trypanosomiasis, with assessments based on xenodiagnosis, conventional serology, and lytic antibodies detection. Three groups of studies were identified based on the treatments used, with the first group consisting of three studies by Apt et al. (1998, 2005) and Coronado et al. (2006) using specific dosages of Itraconazole and Allopurinol, the second group of three studies by Apt et al. (2003) and Sanchez et al. (1995, 2005) using Itraconazole and Allopurinol without specific dosages, and the third group of two studies by Apt et al. (2013) and Venegas et al. (1997) using only Itraconazole. Studies using Itraconazole and Allopurinol with specific dosages were conducted by Apt et al (1998, 2005) and Coronado et al (2006), where a total of 543 patients aged between 9 and 50 years were analyzed. The studies found that 44% of patients achieved parasitologic cure with allopurinol and 53% with itraconazole, with ECG normalization in 36.5% and 48.2% of patients respectively (Apt et al, 1998). In a follow-up study, 19.3% of patients appeared negative in all parasitological tests, and 13 had normal ECG traces at 11-year follow-up (Apt et al, 2005). Coronado et al (2006) found significant differences in the presence of T. cruzi clones in the allopurinol-treated group compared to the non-treated group. All studies reported good drug tolerance, with only four treatments discontinued due to side effects that subsided after suspension of treatment. Studies using Itraconazole and Allopurinol without specific dosages were conducted by Apt et al (2003), Sanchez et al (2005, 1995), where a total of 461 patients aged between 9 and 50 years were analyzed. The studies found that both drugs were equally effective in correcting ECG abnormalities, with itraconazole being better at preventing the development of cardiopathy (Apt et al, 2003). Sanchez et al (2005) found no differences in efficacy among the drugs, with one case considered cured. Sanchez et al (1995) reported a significant reduction in the number of positive xenodiagnoses with allopurinol and itraconazole. All studies reported adequate tolerance and compliance, with no deaths observed during the 9 years of follow-up. Studies using only Itraconazole were conducted by Apt et al (2013) and Venegas et al (1997), where a total of 66 patients were analyzed, with no specified age range. The studies found that 45.6% were infected, 34.7% with normal ECG at baseline maintained the ECG tracing at 20 years, and 10.86% developed ECG abnormalities after 20 years of treatment with itraconazole (Apt et al, 2013). Venegas et al (1997) suggested that the parasitaemia level before therapy could be an important parameter, and that itraconazole might be more effective in cases with low parasitaemias. No mortality attributable to T. cruzi infection was observed in the treated patients, and there was an improvement in minor abnormalities 20 years after treatment. All studies concluded that both itraconazole and allopurinol were effective in treating chronic Chagas' disease, with itraconazole showing better results in preventing the development of cardiopathy. Both drugs were well tolerated with few side effects, and itraconazole was recommended as the preferred treatment. However, some studies suggested that the level of parasitaemia before treatment could influence the efficacy of the drugs, and that itraconazole might be more effective in cases with low parasitaemia. The use of xenodiagnosis and the CoML test were suggested as valuable tools for evaluating treatment efficacy.\"\"\"\n",

            "Article Input: The efficacy of flunarizine compared with placebo for migraine prophylaxis in adults was evaluated in 10 placebo-controlled studies in 453 subjects. Across these studies, subjects with common or classic migraine received treatment with flunarizine 10 mg daily or placebo for durations of 3 to 4 months. Seven of the studies showed a significant effect of flunarizine         compared with placebo in reducing the frequency of migraine attacks, and thus, support the efficacy of flunarizine in prophylaxis of migraine. Across the studies that reported effects on migraine severity and duration, most found no significant decreases in duration or severity of attack with flunarizine versus placebo except for the study by Mendenopoulous et al (1985), which showed a significant reduction in severity of attacks with flunarizine after 2 months of treatment and the study by Diamond and Schenbaum (1983), which showed significant decreases in HUIC (severity and duration) and PIR (pain intensity) indices with flunarizine administered for 12 weeks. Three studies failed to show a significant superiority of flunarizine compared with placebo, although a tendency towards significant differences was observed. This result is likely due the existence of a high placebo effect. Studies of prophylactic treatment of migraine have shown a high variability in the rate of placebo response, which may be due in part to the inherent variability in responses measured over a period of months. In the pooled analysis of 2 identical studies in a total of 143 evaluable subjects (JRD 14,950/002 and JRD 14,950/004), a significant difference in headache index was found between flunarizine and placebo after 1 month of treatment; however, differences in efficacy parameters were only marginally significant for flunarizine at the last visit. Al Deeb et al (1992) noted that baseline factors, including higher mean age, higher number of attacks, and greater number of classic versus common migraineurs in the flunarizine group, may have contributed to the lack of significant differences between the treatments. Thomas et al (1991) found no significant benefit with flunarizine compared with placebo in analysis of individual indices; however, comparison of median values of indices between the treatment groups showed that flunarizine provided statistically significant reductions in all headache indices from baseline and compared with placebo. The efficacy of flunarizine in migraine prophylaxis in adults was evaluated in 32 active-controlled studies in 6,246 subjects. Twelve studies compared flunarizine with beta-blockers including metoprolol, nadolol, and propranolol. Flunarizine was also compared with acupuncture, betahistine, methysergide, nifedipine, nimodipine, nimodipine plus Yufeng Ningxin, pizotifen, topiramate, valproate, Zhengtian capsules, and -DHEC. One study compared 2 different dosages of flunarizine (5 mg and 10 mg daily), 1 study compared conventional flunarizine to a bioequivalent matrix flunarizine formulation, and 1 study compared flunarizine monotherapy to flunarizine combined with tSNS and with tSNS alone. Across the studies that included propranolol as a comparator, all found that flunarizine was at least as effective as propranolol in the prevention of migraine attack in adults. One of these was a large Company-sponsored randomized, double-blind study (FLU-INT-5 [1999]) that included 808 subjects with migraine treated with flunarizine 5 or 10 mg once daily or propranolol 160 mg daily for a duration of 16 weeks. Flunarizine 10 mg was as effective as propranolol in all evaluated efficacy parameters. Flunarizine 5 mg was also as effective as propranolol in reducing mean attack frequency, but more subjects were assessed as responders (had ≥50% decrease in attack frequency) with propranolol. Verspeelt et al (1996) compared flunarizine, at doses of 10 mg/day in those <65 years of age and 5 mg/day in those >65 years of age, to propranolol 40 to 120 mg/day in 1,601 subjects with migraine; the treatment duration was 6 months. Both treatments were effective with no significant difference in the number of attacks or in general feeling of well-being; however, propranolol was superior to flunarizine for reduction in the severity of attacks. One of the reviewed studies concluded that flunarizine resulted in a statistically significant better response rate versus propranolol. Zhang et al (2002) reported that flunarizine 10 mg/day compared with propranolol 30 mg/day, each administered for 8 weeks,provided a significantly greater total response rate of 93% versus 71% with propranolol. Studies that evaluated flunarizine compared with metoprolol or nadolol reported that the treatments were equally effective in the prevention of migraine attacks. In the remaining studies, flunarizine was found to be at least as effective as acupuncture, betahistine,  methysergide,  nifedipine,  nimodipine,  pizotifen, topiramate, valproate, Zhengtian capsules, and -DHEC.  Several of these treatments have not received regulatory approval and are used off label for migraine prevention; additionally, some are no longer recommended in treatment guidelines. Topiramate and valproate, however, are considered first-line treatments for prevention of migraine. In a long-term, randomized study in 150 subjects with migraine with aura (classic) or without aura, flunarizine 5 mg/day reduced the number of migraine and headache days from 4.41.5/month at baseline to 2.5±1.1/month after 12 months of treatment compared with a reduction from 4.61.4/month to 2.60.9/month with topiramate 25 to 100 mg/day. A second randomized study using a flunarizine dose of 10 mg/day compared with topiramate 50 mg/day for 8 weeks in 62 subjects with chronic migraine found reductions from baseline in total headache days/2 weeks of -4.9 with flunarizine vs -2.3 with topiramate (p=0.012) and in total migraine days/2 weeks of -4.3 vs -1.4, respectively (p=0.001). In 2 nonrandomized studies of flunarizine compared with topiramate, similar response rates, defined as subjects with at least 50% reduction in migraine attacks, were observed with flunarizine 5 mg/day and topiramate 100 mg/day (Study 1: 75% vs 70%, respectively; Study 2: 67% vs 71%, respectively). In a randomized, double-open study with flunarizine 10 mg/day and valproate 1 g/day administered for 8 weeks in 44 subjects with migraine with or without aura, each treatment resulted in a significant reduction from baseline in the mean number of migraine attacks (from 4.4 to 1.8 with flunarizine vs 5.1 to 1.6 with valproate; p<0.01 within each group).  Mu et al (2018) reported that nimodipine (120 mg/day) plus Yufeng Ningxin was superior to flunarizine 10 mg/day in reducing the number of migraine days and in response rate after 7 weeks of treatment. However, this study had several limitations including an insufficient study duration of 7 weeks (it should have been at least 3 months for a critical evaluation), lack of a placebo arm or run-in period, and unclear randomization and blinding. Nimodipine has not been approved for migraine prophylaxis and additional use of the herbal remedy Yufeng Ningxin may have accounted for the rapid migraine relief in the nimodipine arm. The secondary endpoint of response rate should have been used as the primary endpoint. The 3 non-controlled, open-label studies in 2,527 subjects are supportive for the efficacy of flunarizine for migraine prophylaxis in adults. All showed significant reductions in headache frequency from baseline with flunarizine 5 to 10 mg/day administered over 12 to 20 weeks. A recently published meta-analysis by Stubberud et al (2019) included 25 placebo- or active-controlled studies with flunarizine for migraine prophylaxis. Twenty-three of the 25 studies in the analysis are also reviewed in this Clinical Overview; the remaining 2 studies evaluated flunarizine dosages outside of those recommended in the Vietnamese Package Insert and were therefore excluded from this Clinical Overview. Stubberud et al reported that flunarizine was superior to placebo, comparable to propranolol, metoprolol, sodium valproate, and topiramate, and superior to pizotifen in reducing migraine frequency. However, acupuncture treatment was superior to flunarizine in reducing migraine frequency, intensity, and drug consumption. The efficacy of flunarizine compared with placebo for migraine prophylaxis in children with classic or common migraine was evaluated in 2 placebo-controlled studies in 118 subjects. Flunarizine 5 mg/day for 12 weeks resulted in statistically significant decreases in migraine attack frequency from baseline. Additionally, comparison of migraine frequency at the end of study showed statistically significantly fewer migraines with flunarizine versus placebo. Treatment with flunarizine also produced significant reductions from baseline in the duration of migraine attacks. The efficacy of flunarizine for migraine prophylaxis in children was compared with topiramate,  propranolol, dihydroergotamine, amitriptyline, cyproheptadine, and acetylsalicylic acid across 5 active-controlled studies in 278 subjects.  The randomized, double-blind study by Lütschg and Vassella (1990) showed that 4-month treatment with flunarizine 5 to 10 mg/day or propranolol 30 to 120 mg/day produced similar reductions in the frequency of migraine attacks  (76.4% flunarizine vs 73.3% propranolol) in children with simple or classic migraine. However, flunarizine had no effect on the duration or intensity of migraine attacks, whereas propranolol showed a decrease in migraine intensity. Similarly, the 4-month, open-label, active-controlled study by Hirfanoglu et al (1987) in children with migraine with or without aura showed a 71.5% reduction in migraine frequency with flunarizine 5 to 10 mg/day; corresponding reductions with amitriptyline 0.5 mg/kg/day, cyproheptadine 0.2 mg/kg/day, and propranolol 10 to 40 mg/day were 80.1%, 78.8%, and 68.2%, respectively. The 6-month non-randomized comparator study by Topcu et al (2014) reported significant decreases in PedMIDAS scores with flunarizine 5 to 10 mg/day, topiramate 1 to 2 mg/kg/day, and propranolol 20 to 40 mg/day, although reductions with topiramate and propranolol were significantly greater compared with flunarizine. 56 Lastra Martinez et al (1990) found similar efficacy with flunarizine (10 mg/day) and dihydroergotamine (3 doses of 1.5 mg/day per week after Week 3) (79% and 87% subjects with improvement, respectively) in migraine frequency, intensity, and duration in children with classic or common migraine. In a prospective, double-blind study in children with classic or uncomplicated migraine, there were no significant differences between flunarizine 5 to 10 mg/day and acetylsalicylic acid 100 to 200 mg/day in reduction of migraine attack frequency or symptoms. An additional study compared the efficacy of flunarizine with flunarizine combined with behavioral therapy in 90 children with migraine. Flunarizine, at doses of 0.2 mg/kg/day up to 10 mg/day, administered for 3 months was found to be more effective when combined with behavioral therapy versus monotherapy, as shown by significantly lower PedMIDAS scores. Four non-controlled open-label studies in 263 subjects are supportive for the efficacy of flunarizine for prevention of migraine in children. An open-label study of flunarizine 10 mg/day administered for 8 weeks to 200 children and adolescents with migraine found a significant decrease in migraine attack frequency and severity. Boccia et al (2006) reported significantly decreased migraine frequency at 1 and 2 months after daily administration of flunarizine 5 mg in children with migraine.  Similarly, Guidetti reported in children with common or classic migraine a significant decrease in migraine frequency after 1 month of treatment with flunarizine 5 mg/day, which was maintained after 6 months of treatment. Visudtibhan et al (2004) found that 66.7% of children administered flunarizine 5 to 10 mg/day had a decrease in migraine frequency. Overall, the reviewed efficacy data from studies of flunarizine in adults and children with migraine support the authorized indication of flunarizine in Vietnam for the maintenance treatment of migraine, when other treatments are ineffective or poorly tolerated. Literature searches to identify relevant studies that support the efficacy and safety of flunarizine in the prevention of migraine in adults and children were performed as reported in Section 4. The available safety results from the reviewed studies are discussed in Section 5.1. The most frequently reported AEs across the placebo-controlled studies of flunarizine for migraine prophylaxis in adults were weight gain and sedation. In the pooled analysis of 2 identical studies in a total of 143 evaluable subjects (JRD 14,950/002 and JRD 14,950/004), there were significantly higher incidences of weight gain (p=0.00131) and depression (p=0.0344) with flunarizine compared with placebo.  Other reported AEs with flunarizine across the reviewed placebo-controlled studies in adults included fatigue, headache, pain, nausea, drowsiness, rhinitis, depression, tiredness, diarrhea, giddiness, galactorrhea, stomach complaints, difficultly sleeping, sleepiness, lethargy, decreased motivation, weight loss, muscle aches, dry mouth, and numbness and tingling in hands.   One SAE of chest pain was reported with flunarizine. The subject had bypass surgery and recovered without sequelae; no further details were reported on the case. One study by Mendenopoulos et al (1985)reported that no adverse reactions occurred and that no changes in body weight were observed with flunarizine. Results from the reviewed 32 active-controlled studies in 6,246 adults with migraine indicate a similar safety profile with flunarizine as observed in the placebo-controlled studies in adults. Across the reviewed studies, the most commonly reported AEs with flunarizine were somnolence, weight gain, fatigue, and drowsiness.  In the Company- sponsored study FLU-INT-5 in 808 subjects, the majority of AEs were mild or moderate in severity. 10 Six subjects reported SAEs; there were no cases of death or EPS. In the large postmarketing observational study in 1,601 subjects, the safety evaluation was focused on EPS and depression.  In those treated with flunarizine, 2 subjects reported EPS and 34 subjects reported depression. Non-controlled, open-label studies in 2,527 subjects reported drowsiness, asthenia, weight increase, fatigue, somnolence, appetite increase, and depression as the most commonly occurring AEs with flunarizine. The meta-analysis of 25 placebo- or active-controlled studies with flunarizine for migraine prophylaxis concluded that flunarizine was well tolerated. The reviewed studies provide evidence supporting the safety of flunarizine in children with migraine. Adverse events reported with flunarizine in 2 placebo-controlled studies with children included drowsiness, weight gain, GI complaints, and fatigue; there were no SAEs reported. Flunarizine had no effect on routine laboratory assessments, blood pressure, or electroencephalogram measurements. Adverse events with flunarizine across the 6 active-controlled studies included drowsiness, paresthesia, increased appetite, weight gain, increased fatigue, shortness of breath, concentration disorders, and stomach pain. No SAEs or cases of EPS were observed. No AEs were reported with flunarizine in non-controlled open-label studies. Overall, the safety data in adults and children in the reviewed studies are consistent with the known safety profile of flunarizine, as described in the current Vietnamese Package Insert.\n",

            "Article Output: The primary objective of these research studies was to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of migraine in children and adolescents, and to evaluate the effectiveness of various treatments, particularly flunarizine, in managing this condition. The studies also aimed to understand the relationship between migraine and other conditions such as functional gastrointestinal disorders, and the impact of these treatments on patients' quality of life. The diagnostic criteria used across the studies varied, but generally included a history of recurrent headaches, often accompanied by other symptoms such as nausea or vomiting, and a lack of response to analgesics. Boccia et al (2006) conducted a study on 60 children suffering from migraines and functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), treating them with a daily dose of 5 mg flunarizine for two months. Chen et al (2014) carried out a similar study on 90 children, dividing them into two groups, one of which received behavioral therapy along with oral flunarizine, while the other group received only oral flunarizine. Guidetti et al (1987) treated 13 preadolescents with severe migraine with a single 5-mg dose of Flunarizine at night for 2 months. Hirfanoglu et al (2009) conducted a controlled clinical trial on 77 children with migraine, treating them with one of four drugs: cyproheptadine, amitriptyline, propranolol, or flunarizine for 4 months. Lutschg et al (1990) conducted a study involving 33 children aged between 3 to 15 years, testing the efficacy of flunarizine and propranolol in migraine prevention, with 4 months of treatment with either drug. Min et al (2012) administered flunarizine to 200 children and adolescents for eight weeks. Topcu et al (2014) divided 88 children with migraine into three treatment groups, receiving either topiramate, flunarizine, or propranolol for 6 months. Visudtibhan et al (2004) administered flunarizine for 6 months in a prospective study on children who had the indication for prophylactic treatment of migraine. Lastra martinez et al (1990) conducted a randomized study on 50 children affected by classic or common migraine, administering either dihydroergotamine or flunarizine for 6 months. Pothmann et al (1987) studied 30 children suffering from at least 2 attacks/month of common or classical migraine for more than 1 year, administering either Acetylsalicylic Acid or Flunarizine for 3 months. Boccia et al (2006) evaluated 50 migrainous children for the prevalence of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) and the effects of flunarizine on gastrointestinal manifestations, finding that gastrointestinal disorders were present in 70% of the patients and that flunarizine significantly reduced the mean frequency of abdominal pain, vomiting, and headache per month. Chen et al (2014) conducted a study on 90 children with migraine, finding significant differences in Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment Score (PedMIDAS) and improved Bussone headache index between the treatment and control groups after 3 months of treatment. Guidetti et al (1987) tested the prophylactic efficacy and side effects of flunarizine in 13 preadolescents with severe migraine, finding a significant decrease in attack frequency. Hirfanoglu et al (2009) evaluated levels of tumor necrosis factor a, interleukin-16, interleukin-6, and leptin in children with migraine after various therapies, finding that each of the four drugs decreased the frequency, duration, severity of headache, and the PedMIDAS score. Lutschg et al (1990) found a reduction in the number of migraine attacks in 75% of the flunarizine group and in 73.8% of the propranolol group. Min et al (2012) analyzed 200 migraine patients, finding a significant decrease in both the frequency and severity of migraines after eight weeks of treatment with flunarizine. Topcu et al (2014) analyzed the efficacy of topiramate, propranolol, and flunarizine in 88 patients with migraines, finding that all three treatments significantly decreased the PedMIDASs, but topiramate and propranolol were more effective than flunarizine. Visudtibhan et al (2004) observed improvement in 66% of patients who received flunarizine, with 23% having no recurrent attack. Lastra Martinez et al (1990) administered dihydroergotamine or flunarizine to 50 children affected by classic or common migraine, finding significant improvement in the frequency, intensity, and length of the episodes in 87% of cases with dihydroergotamine and in 79% of cases with flunarizine. Pothmann et al (1987) studied 30 children suffering from common or classical migraine and found no significant difference in the reduction of attack frequency or symptoms between acetylsalicylic acid and flunarizine. Boccia et al (2006) found that subjects treated with flunarizine experienced no relevant side effects during their study. However, Chen et al (2014) and Hirfanoglu et al (2009) did not provide specific safety results or adverse events in their respective studies on children with migraines. Guidetti et al (1987) reported no significant interference with pituitary, beta-pancreatic, or gonadal function after treatment, and no serious side effects in 10- to 13-year-olds over a 2-month course. Lutschg et al (1990) noted temporary side effects in a few patients, with increased fatigue being the most common. Min et al (2012) found flunarizine to be effective and safe for migraine prophylactic treatment in a study of 200 patients. Topcu et al (2014) found that Topiramate treatment caused side effects such as dizziness, lack of attention, and palpitations in a few cases, and Flunarizine was withdrawn in four patients as it proved ineffective. Visudtibhan et al (2004) observed no adverse effects in their study. Lastra martinez et al (1990) found that a small percentage of patients experienced side effects with dihydroergotamine and flunarizine, but these were tolerable and did not require changes in the therapeutic regimen. Pothmann et al (1987) reported minor side effects such as slight body weight gain or abdominal pain after intake, but these did not necessitate interruption of prophylaxis. They also found no effects on blood pressure and heart rate during the observation period in either the ASS or flunarizine groups. Studies have shown that flunarizine is effective in reducing the frequency, intensity, and duration of migraines in children. It has been found to be particularly beneficial in children with vegetative lability and those with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). The drug has also been shown to improve the quality of life of patients, as measured by the Pediatric Migraine Disability Assessment Score (PedMIDAS). However, some studies have found that other drugs, such as topiramate and propranolol, may be more effective than flunarizine in reducing the frequency and duration of migraines. In terms of safety, flunarizine has been generally well-tolerated, with the most common side effect being increased fatigue. However, some studies have reported other side effects such as dizziness, lack of attention, palpitations, and weight gain. Despite these side effects, the drug has been deemed safe for use in children and adolescents.\n",
